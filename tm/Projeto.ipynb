I'm sure I don't want them again so I'm closer to \"I don't like\" than \"OK\".<br /><br />The good:<br />The salt content IS pretty good. On par with how we season our own.<br />They're crisp.<br /><br />The bad:<br />Seeds are pretty small which means the ratio between seed and shell is not great.<br />Small seeds means you almost can't shell them, you HAVE to eat the shells.<br />Too many seeds have a sour taste which ruins the hole experience.<br />Per ounce they're more expensive than any others I've tried.<br /><br />I wish David's Seeds put out a lighter sea salt version. Their seeds are much larger so you can peel the shells if you want. They just have too much salt. I remember eating the Indian brand when I was a kid. They had a great tasting seed but unfortunately even more salt than Davids.\n",

      "Review: Mayonnaise is an interesting product, cool, smooth and creamy it's the lush counter partner of the low cal mustard but it's of those things people think they don't like until they taste it in the proper way and that's all it takes for a secret love affair with luxe sauces  and recipes that can be made with it to start.<br /><br />I am a big fan of sandwiches and any new way I can spruce them up, especially with nice sauces and spices is always at the top of my new ideas to make for lunch or to fill into an interesting menu on the weekends. The Rouille is spicy, that I deducted just from looking at the angry orange color in the jar, the color of auburn harvest on a stormy night. The taste is of cream immersed in a sea of chili peppers and garlic with a peppery background. My favorite way to eat it is in a sandwich with a leftover cold coconut breaded chicken cutlet with some crisp romaine in between two toasted crusty slices of bread smeared on the inner sides with the Rouille spicy mayonnaise . The taste is a tropical rendition of a Caesar Chicken Sandwich I get at Hale and Hearty here in NYC but much easier since I made it at home and it took no effort.<br /><br />Great on bread, meat or as a condiment to any afternoon snack or smeared on some California roll for a spicy finish. There is no end to the amount of uses this product provides.<br /><br />- Kasia S.\n",

      "Review: Barry Farms is known for their quality and rare, hard-to-find ingredients. Xanthan Gum is no exception, but anything can be found on Amazon, right? Barry Farms to the rescue!<br /><br />Xanthan Gum is used to modify the viscosity of liquids, on a very low scale (typically 1/3 tsp per 1 gallon). Because of the difficulty in combining Xanthan Gum to a liquid evenly, you should mix this into your liquid very slowly, in a blender at full speed, and it should be one of your steps (before adding other ingredients, including Guar Gum).<br /><br />Many ice creams and popsicles, even Italian ices, call for two main ingredients: Xanthan Gum and sometimes Guar Gum (also available from Barry Farms: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015UC5M?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8). Both of these gums behave quite differently, and Xanthan Gum can be harder to mix into your liquid solution (again, mix in slowly via blender running on high), but both are effective means to preventing crystallization of liquids, which is the secret to making softer ice cream and popsicles instead of rock hard ice!<br /><br />Another interesting characteristic of Xanthan Gum is its ability to thin out when subjected to forces such as shaking (called shearing), which makes it great for poured sauces, as it will thicken back up after having exited the bottle. It can also prevent oils from separating from liquid-oil emulsions (think salad dressing). It is also more stable under a wider range of temperatures and pH than other gums.<br /><br />Xanthan Gum can also be used to give dough the stickiness that is needed in gluten-free baking, as gluten is usually what gives that sticky characteristic to dough. And no matter the use, Xanthan Gum will always remain colorless and flavorless, so it can be used for just about any need that suits it.\n",

I just opened up my 3rd bottle and I still haven't really noticed much of anything. The taste isn't too bad.<br /><br />The following comment is for the person who previously reviewed the product: I believe that what you were looking at was NOT the expiration date but rather the date it was made. I bought this product as well and was worried that I would have the same problem as you described until I realized that it had an expiry date as well as a production date. The production date was dated as \"something/something 2011.\" And incidentally, the expiry date on my product was shown to be \"something/something 2013\" so that also prompts me to think that you probably looked at the wrong date and mistook 2011 for the expiry date.\n",

      "Review: Anyone else have seasonal allergy type reactions? This stuff, for me, is hayfever allergies in a bottle.<br /><br />I performed a little test and here are all the details:<br /><br />- after taking it Monday twice each day, I thought I suddenly had caught a cold or developed seasonal allergies... I was REALLY bad Tuesday.  I had to resort to aspirin and Benadryl to get through the day. It was truly awful and I wanted to go home early for feeling so sick. Headache, itchy eyes, watery mouth, constantly stuffed and runny nose, tired...<br /><br />- After staying up quite late and finally falling asleep with the window open and the fan on, blowing in whatever pollen or cold air was outside, I woke up today (Wed) feeling totally fine. This is when I knew something was up. No cold or seasonal allergies disappears overnight with the window open and a fan on you.<br /><br />- So, I did an experiment today. I waited until halfway through the day (2pm) to take the first dose of African Bush Mango juice... the recommended dosage of 2 tbsp. A half hour after drinking this stuff, a mild headache came on, then within the next hour my eyes began itching and my throat felt scratchy and my mouth started feeling watery and, finally, I started sneezing and blowing my nose again.<br /><br />No doubt about it, this produces a seasonal allergy type reaction for me. Only other time ingesting anything ever did something like this was when I thought I would just go ahead and throw the beet stems in my juicer to be \"extra healthy.\" I am not allergic to beets, but beet stems made my eyes run green snot. This stuff produces almost as bad a reaction. So... throwing away the full $18 bottle when I get home.\n",

I take it with every meal consisting of balanced proteins, carbs and fats. Sometimes if I go overboard and overeat I definitely make sure I use it before I engage in a heavy meal.I now have a lot of loose body fat particularly around my waist and upper back area. I look forward to going to the gym to do my cardio and toning excercises to tighten up the loose skin. This juice has definitely made a difference in losing my ab fat. This was my most difficult area to lose. I am a size 10 at the top but wear a size 4 in skirts and pants. Obviously my most stubborn and difficult areas are my abs, back and upper body.I like the taste of this particular brand. I did try another brand but did not like the flavor as much as I like this one. That's the only reason I am able to continue using because the flavor is great. I will continue to use this brand until I reach my goal of fat loss. I've tried alot of products but this seems to be working the best for right now.\n",

      "Review: This is a repeat of the same review I left for another Amazon listing for the same tea (but at a significantly different price).  Despite the price difference, both listings appear to be for the same item and are sold by the same Indian Grocery.  From reading the other reviews, it is clear that at least one other customer had the same bad experience as I did.<br /><br />I was initially excited to find Lipton Yellow Label Tea on Amazon, as I just got back from Italy and fell in love with it there.  The Lipton Yellow Label Tea in Italy doesn't taste anything like the weak, poor-quality Lipton we get in the U.S., but the tea I ordered on Amazon (sold by Simply Beautiful) is actually manufactured for India and tastes bitter and/or stale.  You can't see from the photo, but the writing on the packages I received is not in English and says it was manufactured in Canada for India.  It is hard to tell whether the variety sold in India just tastes different than the kind in Italy, or if the tea was in fact stale, because there is NO sell-by or expiration date on the package (very disturbing), and the bags are NOT \"foil-wrapped for freshness\" as described on Amazon.  I was extremely disappointed in the taste of this tea from India, having looked forward to the lovely, full-bodied Lipton Yellow Label tea bags that I brought home from Italy.  Not to mention the fact that I would never want to buy imported groceries that don't have an expiration date, so there is no way to know how long they've been sitting in the warehouse, if they are stale, or when they will go stale after opening (especially since they are not individually wrapped).  I returned both boxes of tea and hope to get an Amazon refund soon.  I am very bummed.\n",

      "Review: The Lipton Yellow Label tea is a step above the \"regular\" Lipton sold here in the States. This is your basic, everyday black tea but it is much more flavorful and bolder than the Lipton variety sold in supermarkets here. It brews a good, bracing cup of tea. I recommend it over the supermarket variety any day. I have used this to make iced tea as well and while it's good over ice, it is best served hot.\n",

      "Review: I must echo the praise of Lipton Yellow Label tea.<br /><br />I don't know how this label may differ across countries, but recently I spent several month-long trips to Pakistan, where Lipton Yellow Label is pretty much all the black tea they serve, and tea is served all the time.  After getting around the initial shock of their custom of putting up to four teabags into 16 ounces of water there, I came to like the Yellow Label tea.  Then when switching a few times to Twinings tea at the hotel business center, I realized that Yellow Label is much better than all the tea I'd been drinking heretofore.  Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.  A Pakistani friend who travels to the U.S. says that American tea is \"insipid\" and refuses to drink it.  I now agree, and think that Lipton Yellow Tea is the best tea I have ever had.  Now I've got to figure out where to buy it.  As far as I'm concerned, Yellow Label is the tea most worth drinking, which no doubt accounts for its popularity in Pakistan.\n",

Lipton sells it in many countries, and while the product might have the same smooth, almost inoffensive base note, to me the UK version tastes very different than the Indian version, which is perceptable stronger and has a more \"citrusy\" note. While it doesn't hold up to some premium orange pekoe teas, it is distinctly better than the Lipton tea available in US supermarkets.\n",

I had only had the \"brisk\" version before and wasn't such a Lipton fan, but I needed tea and bought it.<br /><br />Contrary to the rather dusty, mild (watery??) taste of the \"brisk\" American version, Yellow Label has a good flavor and no bitterness, even when brewing for 6 min (I brew a small pot with three bags in the morning). Not quite as rich as Assam tea when mixed with milk and sugar, but a good substitute. And you can't beat the price. A very nice, full every-day tea.\n",

Opening the can of Artemis, one sees a solid dog food, light in color with bits of foods like carrots, peas, and potatoes readily visible.<br /><br />Our three pooches like Artemis and  their parents do also. The ingredient list is commendable with no fillers and none of those horrendous animal scraps found in cheaper dog foods. Mostly I like seeing the inclusion of potatoes in the mix. We like the density of the canned food; those runny canned products with high liquid content tend to dirty and stain the canine whiskers and beard. One user of Artemis commented that her dog had much less gas and fewer stools. I'll have to monitor our girls more closely to see if this is the case with them. I do notice a welcome firmness in Evie's stools though.

      "Review: Our Rhodesian Ridgebacks were on this food some years back and we moved, thus losing access to it at the new location. I am very glad to see Amazon carrying Canidae and that it's available using the Prime Membership! We have fed many, many dogs the Canidae when we we were fostering rescue dogs (an average of 3 new dogs a month for years) and it was the only food NONE of them ever had any trouble eating & digesting. Our own pack has a couple of members with soy allergies, so I'm careful about what we feed. They have been back on the Canidae for a few months now with no drama at all. The switch from their old food back to the Canidae was easy and stress free and all 6 dogs scarf it down like it was prime rib. (or you know...a squirrel) Even my father's Chihuahua likes it and that little diva used to think she could only eat human food! I have been able to cut back by a half cup on the daily ration for our largest dog as he was putting extra weight on with his previous amount from the old food. Everyone's coat is soft and shiny, they all have loads of energy and are generally in excellent overall health - that doesn't happen with the grocery store bargain foods. Again, I am VERY VERY glad to see the big bags of Canidae available from Amazon!!\n",

A bit of an aftertaste sent me searching for the ingredients list, which is not on the individual cup but is on the original packaging. Sucralose is hiding in the ingredients, which, while not a big deal, is not a taste I enjoy. Prospective buyers should be aware of the presence of an artificial sweetener, which is not advertised or noted in any way in the product description on Amazon. (The manufacturer website notes that both natural and artificial sweeteners are used.) It's certainly something I'll be checking before making future purchases of this type of item.

I'd already been told by a family member not to go with the \"large\" setting on my Keurig, as it could make cocoa taste watery.  So I dutifully chose \"medium,\" and oh, how I wish watery were the problem.  It had such a horrible bitter taste that I at first thought my water had somehow been contaminated.  After reading other reviews here, I realize that it must be the sucralose.  I consider it not only very misleading advertisting for each cup not to be labeled as \"diet\" in some way, but sucralose also happens to be my least favorite of the major artificial sweeteners.  I don't know what the calorie count on these things would be, but if it happens to be low then I'd recommend trying this only if you're dieting and really desperate.

I was concerned that it would taste watered down because I feel that many of the Keuring coffees taste that way; I like the extra bold varieties or Starbucks Italian Roast on my own K cup.<br /><br />I was actually rather pleasantly surprised as to how much like real hot cocoa it tasted.  Not watered down and not too sweet.  It's not gourmet but this winter, when you want a quick cup of hot cocoa after shoveling snow or playing outside, this will do nicely.\n",

I thought how it would be nice if so much chocolate wasn't left in the k-cup after brewing (yes, I removed the foil, to recycle the cup).  I decided to shake the cup before inserting into the Keurig, and I'll remove it and re-insert after twisting it 180°, giving it another hole to brew from, which DOES help.  I prefer the taste of this to Swiss Miss or Nestle for sure.  I also add Vanilla or Irish Creme powdered CoffeeMate creamer which thickens it up a bit, or will add some Bailey's or Amaretto after shovelling show.  I like the Dark Chocolate version as well.\n",

After using the product for a few days, i noticed my wife replaced her normal morning ice coffee with diet soda. She couldn't stand the Splenda, it was giving her a dry mouth and bad taste. i had noticed something a little \"off\" but just dismissed it as my imagination. Later i tried a sample straight from the envelope, it had a very acrid taste and seemed to burn -- it certainly wasn't SWEET. i then did a blind taste test using a new, small box that i bought from a local grocery store. night and day difference.  in summary, i think i got either an old/expired box (there's no obvious expiration date on the box), or the product might have soaked up an odor/taste from something during transit.\n",

Sadly, some animals were sickened, and even died. After this recall, it's fair to say that many of us had become even more aware of how the pet food industry is regulated and how lapses are corrected, which is a great thing. Knowledge is power, as the saying goes.<br /><br />The FDA posted a new announcement for a voluntary pet food recall on June 18 - relating to Natural Balance Pet Foods, Inc. More specifically, the company discovered that there was the possibility of salmonella contamination in 5- and 28-pound bags of their Sweet Potato and Chicken Dry Dog Food. Consumers who have purchased that formula need to look for a \"best by\" date of June 17, 2011.<br /><br />Flickr photo courtesy of Denise Chan<br />Salmonella, also referred to as salmonellosis, causes digestive problems, and dogs will typically present with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and weakness. Other symptoms can occur.<br />Salmonella is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it can be passed to humans as well, so care needs to be taken. Hand washing is a must - even when handling dry pet food that may be contaminated with the bacteria.<br /><br />To keep up to date with current recalls and information on pet food safety, visit the FDA's website to view the updated list that includes not only dog and cat foods, but also horse feed.<br /><br />[...]\n",

She was on Wellness before and the vet switched her to a special canned food.  Then he had me switch her to Science Diet Sensitive Stomach.  She did fine on the canned food, but got sick with the Science Diet.  Once I started this food, she stopped getting sick.  It was a miracle!  Her gas has gone away and she has kept the food down for over two months.  I'm so happy with this food!  I switched her brother onto the food too, and they both love it.\n",

      "Review: Natural Balance dog food is great, but the dog food I purchased from Amazon was not completely satisfactory.  There was about a 4 pound clump of dog food that was so hard and compressed, it would have been unreasonable to break apart or use.  a 5 pound bag of this dog food goes for $13, so  I feel like I lost money on this purchase for the convenience of having it delivered instead of an in-store pickup.  I won't be purchasing dog food from Amazon again.  I don't feel as if they rotate the food out as well as it would if one were to purchase it from Petco or PetSmart.\n",

      "Review: I ordered the natural balance salmon dry dog food because I had good luck with the natural balance salmon dry cat food.  Further, I am a pescatarian and was disappointed to see how almost every dry dog and cat food brand at the grocery stores and on the market contain chicken, lamb, or beef bi -products.  I love my dogs, but I cannot see feeding baby lamb to my dog! Even the \"only fish\" labelled dog and cat foods on the market often contain chicken, etc when you look on the ingredients list.  So I was very pleased to find a cost effective solution to this in natural balance.  The only issue is that my dogs will not touch this food! They would rather starve than eat it it seems, perhaps because it is the diet formula?  I'm not sure.  However, I will say that they all (including the cat) flock to the Natural Balance salmon dry cat food lol so I will continue ordering that for the cat.\n",

I then Googled the brand and found a recall due to salmonella contamination! Granted, the recall wasn't on this specific mix, but when I tried to contact the company they haven't even bothered to respond within four days! I ran out and found another vet who carries science diet and within a day or two my dogs is energetic and back to his old self.  This dog food is supposed to be 100% guaranteed, just return the unused portion back to the retailer - yeah, shipping 28 lbs of dog food back to Amazon and finding the box it will fit in  is real convenient...\n",

The plastic taste was minimized, but still there. Now after about one month of usage, the coffee it makes still tastes bad.<br /><br />We use the Green Mountain Keurig cups, so I doubt it's the coffee itself. For comparison, I went out and bought McDonald's black coffee (they use Newman's Own), and added sugar and creamer myself. The McDonald's coffee tasted much better, just pure and clean.<br /><br />For another reference point, we used to have a different model of Keurig, and that machine definitely made better coffee than this one. I wouldn't say it made great coffee, but it did not impart plastic taste.<br /><br />I have since resorted to buying my own coffee whenever possible, so it's difficult for me to give this more than one star.\n",

      "Review: My daughter picked this one out - she LOVES truffles and of course raspberry is one of her favorites. She has not got to try it yet as she is at work but I had to sneak a bit since I was putting my matcha powders into their tins.<br /><br />So this one has a very nice raspberry flavor, although I seem to be missing the chocolate flavor, not that I taste no chocolate but its not like the chocolate matcha flavor.  However truffles have a very distinctive flavor to them - which for me is difficult to describe, but this does taste very true to an actual truffle and not simply to flavors of matcha mixed together. So its not just some chocolate flavor with raspberry flavor but however this was blended with whatever ingredients it is true to that truffle aroma and flavor. I wish I could explain the flavor I am talking about maybe it is some kind of special nut oil that is used or something but there is just a flavor to truffles that is different and this matcha absolutely has captured it!<br /><br />So today I began with the preparation of the matcha and was going to do my typical latte but last minute before adding the creamer decided to use a scoop of natural vanilla ice cream hubby was so lovely to pick up for me. So my blend included the prepared matcha along with some ice cubes, a quarter cup of milk, and a small scoop of ice cream. It was not that amazing of a plan since the ice cubes and ice cream wanted to be stubborn but I took a long tea spoon and mixed it up and ate it something like a float.<br /><br />Mmmmm absolutely delicious! The raspberry truffle flavor popped along with the creamy ice cream here and there in a milky frothy treat!<br /><br />The lingering after taste is what is most astounding! I had this matcha latte shake concoction over 15 minutes ago and I am still tasting raspberry chocolaty goodness in my mouth!<br /><br />Of course as always Red Leaf Tea's matcha base is outstanding!\n",

I may use this in hot or iced tea on occasion but doubt I will use it as a stand-alone flavor enhancer.<br /><br />If you're looking for a sweetener and are familiar with the super sweetness of Stevia, this is worth trying.

      "Review: I don't personally eat this product so I can't vouch for the flavor and texture. I do, however, buy it here and buy it often as I donate it regularly to my church for their special dinners for the homeless, those in need, and fundraiser suppers.<br /><br />The pastor tells me that those who do the cooking for the church, as well as those being served enjoy it a lot and many ask for 'seconds'. The pastor advises me it makes a great side dish and helps to fill up hungry tummies  while being so easy to make. On occasion, the church cooks will add their own additional onions and celery, but it isn't necessary as this stuffing includes all that and more. And,because this is a 'herb' flavor, adding chicken stock or turkey stock vs. water makes it even more complimentary to a chicken/turkey meal.<br /><br />The price here at Amazon is better than that at the local grocery stores, esp. with my Prime for free shipping. I can also get it in 1-2 days if the church needs extra with short notice. Good deal, good product, prompt service.<br /><br />Edit: 2-25-10 (after-thought). All one needs to add to this product is butter and water. Depending on how moist/dry one prefers stuffing, simply add more/less water. Our church roasts turkeys and hen turkeys in large quantities very often and we strain and freeze the 'au jus' from them in 12 oz plastic containers. Occasionally, rather than using up our butter supply for stuffing, we substitute the defrosted au jus from the turkey. This seems to be the preferred 'flavor' by those enjoying the meals.\n",

      "Review: I have diabetic cat. My cat started exhibiting symptoms and I went to my vet who started him on insulin. He progessively got worse, as the insulin doses steadily increased. My super smart, very litter trained cat got completely out of his mind one night and climbed on top of a shoe box and peed. Poor thing didn't know where he was or what was going on.<br /><br />At that, I went to the internet and found yourdiabeticcat.com. I started reading and was so skeptical but out of pure desperation I started doing what the people on the boards there suggested. I started tracking my cat's blood sugar daily at home myself. I took him off of dry food and started feeding him fancy feast classics. His blood sugars eventually started leveling out.<br /><br />I went back to my vet and informed her of my changes with my cat and she was amazed. I asked her to research some concerns I had with the fancy feast. She researched it for me and told me the fancy feast is fine. My cat no longer gets insulin shots. I honestly couldn't believe it myself. He is back to his normal self: smart, energetic, and using his litter.<br /><br />I now buy this food automatically off of amazon in three different flavors for variety. I have two cats and they both love all three classic flavors that I buy. (Turkey, Chicken and Beef) I highly recommend this food for the health of your cat.<br /><br />Also, I have two large male cats and they eat an average of 3 cans a day each. Hopefully that will help you figure out how much you need for your cat. If for some reason, they get full and don't finish a full can in one sitting I have to cover up the left overs. They will not eat them if they have dried out, but they will eat them if I have covered them and allowed them to retain their moisture.\n",

Can't figure this one out - it smells nice in the can, not strange odors that I can detect anyway.  It's pretty expensive to just toss but well, that's what I had to do.  It is healthy for your cat and it is a pate, not chunks.  However, that said, they don't care for the chunky Fancy Feast turkey variety either.  Not sure why - they gobble up the Friskies turkey and cheese like there's no tomorrow.  Not sure what to recommend here but to try it and see if your cat likes it.  Maybe it's just too boring! :)\n",

In fact, I had to go there twice in a two day period just because I found myself craving the dressing.<br /><br />I went to the grocery store in search of a a similar dressing and scored a home run with this one. I'm not sure if the restaurants house dressing was better, or this one, but this one is really good.<br /><br />I like to marinate chicken in it, top a green salad with olives, tomato, and cucumbers, or even just drizzle it over a stuffed pita sandwich. I also like to finely dice carrots, cucumbers, green peppers, and tomatoes and top it with this dressing for a quick salad or healthy topping after marinating in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. It's also good for dipping grilled chicken breast strips.<br /><br />The calories are low on this dressing at only 60 calories per serving. Unlike thick dressings like ranch or honey mustard, this one really does only require the suggested serving of two tablespoons since it's thinner and coats everything very well.<br /><br />Diabetics will be glad to know there is only one gram of sugar per serving, and it also has no trans fats.<br /><br />For an Italian salad dressing, this is my top pick.\n",

      "Review: Whether or not it's right for you is up to you and your pediatrician to decide. We began adding it to our son's formula at 2 months because of health related issues. We currently use 1 scoop (scoop from Gerber formula can) of rice to 2 scoops of formula, and 4-5 oz of water. It mixes exceptionally well and is not \"goopy\" nor does it leave \"rice-sludge\" at the bottom of the bottle after feeding.<br />We love this, and buy it over the box cereal every time now. Even our daycare has commented on how much they like this over the traditional flakes of rice cereal. The can fits better in the pantry than the box, and is much cleaner since it isn't leaking flakes from the corners and the fold down spout. The cans stack easily, and are the same size and shape as Gerber's formula cans.<br />We initially purchased this from my wife's work, and when they ran out we switched back to box rice. It's cheaper from Amazon than it is at the local grocery stores. We're switching back to the can.<br /><br />Pros<br />-It contains DHA to boost development.<br />-Dissolves better; its more of a powder than the flakes you get in the box of Gerber rice cereal.<br />-Because it dissolves better it is easier for the infant to drink, and easier to clean the bottle after feeding (large undissolved flakes don't clog the bottle).<br />-Packaging is much cleaner than the boxes of rice cereal available from Gerber.<br /><br />Cons<br />-It's not Vegan (if you care, I don't, but some other posters obviously do).<br />-It does not come with a scoop. This is only a very minor inconvenience, as we, like the other poster, used the scoop from the can of Gerber formula that we use.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.\n",

      "Review: I gave this to my baby thinking the DHA and probiotic aspects were a plus. In theory, they are.<br /><br />We originally started with another brand's organic rice cereal. It listed only a few ingredients: Rice, Rice Bran Extract, Tocopherols (Vitamin E), alpha-Amylase (Enzyme), Electrolytic Iron. Gerber's DHA/Probiotic rice cereal has a very long ingredient list, I think because of all of the vitamins it is fortified with. Well, that is fine. Wish it were more basic, but ok.<br /><br />My son loves \"normal\" rice cereal. With this DHA rice cereal, he will tolerate it, but he definitely noticed the difference. He kind of scrunches up his face. Today his made a gagging face and acted like he was going to throw it up. I don't know if that is because he doesn't like the weird flavor or what.  I tasted it too, and I can't stand the fishy sense I get when I eat it. It isn't a strong or overpowering fishy flavor, but there is definitely a weird aftertaste going on. You can still notice it when you mix in fruit or sweet potatoes to try and cover it up.<br /><br />I don't think I will finish the can we started. Back to the other brand for us. Bummer, Gerber. Wish they could use algae based DHA rather than Tuna oil.\n",

      "Review: Unfortunately, Gerber is using tuna oil as a source of DHA. This is very bad for the environment - tuna is severely over-fished and people should not really be eating tuna at all. They should switch to a plant- or algae-based source of DHA. Until then, I suggest that you avoid this product if you care about the environment. By the way, a fish-based source of DHA does have a higher chance of being contaminated by toxic chemicals like mercury. This is one of the reasons why people seeking higher DHA levels in their diet have switched to plant-based sources such as flaxseed oil.\n",

It was just bland, rice cereal. This was just disgusting. Although, it might not be the taste that's making him gag. This stuff has a seriously weird texture. It must be the gelatin. It was really frustrating to me to mix up. I'd get it to what I thought was a good consistency and a few minutes later it would turn into this runny mess, sort of like paste. Awful!

About 3/4 cup prepared.\"<br /><br />Flavor? That depends on you. The directions recommend adding bouillon but a lot of bouillon just winds up being chunks of MSG. Most recently I tried adding some jamaican jerk flavoring and it worked well. You can use this as a base, throwing other ingredients, veggies, etc. to turn this into your own creation. This cooks up in maybe fifteen minutes.<br /><br />Only drawback, which may not be a nuisance to you, is that preparation as directed uses two pans, one to boil the liquid ingredients and a second to griddle up the kasha with egg coating before combining the two into one pan. That's not enough of a drawback to prevent me from stocking up on more Wolff's Kasha.\n",

Each puff was not completely crunchy; they sort of slowly melt in your mouth as you chew!<br /><br />I will definitely recommend anyone who looking for a healthy snack alternative this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />A healthy snack<br />Lightly covered in cheese<br />Delicious, too!<br /><br />Cons:<br />It is so hard to put down a bag!\n",

However, eating Gourmet Smart Puffs is a somewhat startling experience. Pop a couple of the puffs into your mouth chew a few times and it feels like a crunchy mouthful of cheesy air.

Baked in a dutch oven with the lid on in my kitchen oven @350F with the convection fan running.  Cooked to 200F~210F internal temp.  Just brilliant very close match to how I remember a wheat flour cake tasting.  Great crumb.  Highly recommended. As I'm a fan of hot Rooibos tea without sugar and no sugar added pie fillings the sweetness was perfect for me.  Very easy to add sugar or Splenda to increase the sweetness.

      "Review: Here's what it says over the label-  Total Carbs 41, Fiber -5, Protected Carbs -31 = digestible carbs 5<br /><br />Now, what the hell are \"protected carbs\"?  No one knows.  This is a term that the company coined themselves.  And they don't really give any explaination either.  When you go on their website they claim that these \"protected carbs\" are not digestible.  Really?  Well then why don't you go ahead and tell us what exactly they are then?<br /><br />I asked 2 nutritionists about this and they both told me that they are familiar with Dreamfields Pasta and both stated it is a scam that uses tricky wording on their labels!  One nutritionist told me that her patients would have no insulin spike but then 4 hours after eating the pasta suddenly it would spike drastically.  She believes all this pasta does is slow the digestion to a point where it tricks people for a few hours into thinking they are taking in only 5 carbs.  Both doctors said that the real net carb content of this pasta is actually around 36.  Which is still less than other pastas, but not by much.  I eat this pasta as I am not diabetic and it does taste good and have less carbs, but I have diabetic relatives and I would never cook it for them.  When I'm done with the dreamfields I have left over I'm going to try Carba-Nada pasta...which isn't really low carb, but it's lower than Dreamfields and they don't have tricky nutrition labels.  Haven't tried it yet though so I can't comment on it any more than that.\n",

I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!\n",

      "Review: First the taste - I'm a huge pasta lover and this tastes just as good to me as any pre-made pasta I've ever had. It's also completely filling and satisfying.<br /><br />I'm pre-diabetic and so far seem to have elevated blood sugar only in the mornings, so this may not be relevant to people with full diabetes, but here are the results of my tests. An evening meal including a double portion of Dreamfields and 30 grams of carbs from another dish gave me a modest rise in blood sugar, about what I'd expect from a 40-50 gram meal. On another occasion when I ate a double portion of Dreamfields alone in the late morning, my blood sugar had dropped slightly six hours later. I had read a couple of people complaining that they got high readings eight hours or so after eating Dreamfields but this doesn't seem to happen to me.<br /><br />Extra fiber is always another plus. With the lowered carbs Dreamfields should also be lower calorie but there don't seem to be any official claims for that.<br /><br />Again according to my readings: don't overcook it, reheat it, or cook it in something acidic like tomato sauce or the carb-hiding effect will be lost. (It's fine to add tomato sauce after the pasta is cooked.)<br /><br />The only drawback is the price, but it's well worth it to be able to eat pasta and not be concerned about the carbs.\n",

So I emailed for an explanation and the explanation was equally evasive. It says to essentially to forget the FDA required nutritional label of 190 calories because you will only be digesting 129 calories. So I asked and they later confirmed that yes you are actually putting 190 calories in your mouth, but I guess you have to accept their opinion that you only will absorb 129. I keep a journal of all calories, so do I document 190 or 129? If it was only 129 why would they be required to put 190? To me it sounds like a game, the same game they appear to be playing with the carb count. Unless it is otherwise univerally accepted by the scientific community I say it has 190 calories.\n",

      "Review: Off and on over the years I've kept a package of pepperoni in the frig because it's a great \"seasoning\" product.  You can throw a few into just about any savory dish to add extra flavor.  It works a lot like bacon in that regard, in those instances where you don't need a lot of meat, but a little helps to round out the dish.  You can use these instead of adding flavoring fats too, like butter or olive oil.  It adds variety and broadens your options especially for quick cooking, or when you are out of some of your usual basics and don't feel like running to the store.<br /><br />The problem sometimes is that some brands of pepperoni taste a bit odd - perhaps chemically, or greasy, or papery and bland.  These are good.  I will say that these aren't super-intensely flavored, but to my mind that is good for my purposes.  If you want to get an intensely flavored pepperoni for a particular application or for direct snacking, I figure you want to hit up your local Italian market.<br /><br />I also like the size and thinness of these - they are very thin, which I think is great, because I typically would use these in circumstances where I would want only a few and well distributed in small pieces.  I can use these whole where with some other brands that are cut thicker I'd typically have to cut them up some first.<br /><br />These also taste fresh and have a nice texture.\n",

I emailed Now Foods requesting information concerning the mercury content of their granulated fructose because I consume so much of it. Their response was \"mercury is less than 400 parts per billion\". For myself this is unacceptable because I eat fructose and mercury is poisonous. I wish they would bring it down to a reasonable level or better yet find a new way of distilling fructose that is as economical as the Castner-Kellner process.\n",

      "Review: I usually use Only Natural Pet Easy Raw dehydrated food, however I wanted to try Honest Kitchen's brand just to see how it compared, it looked & smelled like a pile of mush grass.  My dogs avoided it like the plague even my little girl who eats anything that is not nailed down.  I was panicking thinking I just wasted a huge chunk of money on something my fur kids won't eat when the Mail<br />Man rang and my delayed shipment of Only Natural brand freeze-dried chicken & beef patties came.  I was soooo happy!!!! I ripped open a bag of chicken, took a sniff, OMG it smelled so good!!!  I quickly crumbled the patty into the pile of green mush and my dogs scarfed it down in 5 minutes.  This food is so great & convenient.  Since it is expensive, I'm going to use it as a flavor enhancer in combination with other raw foods.  The Honest Kitchen food is very nutritious and easy to rehydrate.  However, it needs to be enhanced or combined with other ingredients such as meats (beef,turkey,chicken,buffalo, etc). I also add fish oil for shiney coats and sometimes add a raw egg as well.\n",

I finally stumbled upon unsweetened Almond Breeze vanilla which has 4 grams of carbs and So Delicious vanilla coconut milk which has 9 grams of carbs.  I still have half a dozen sugary rice milks that I'm watering down with homemade almond milk just to reduce the terrifying sugar level.  Unsweetened Almond Breeze tastes smooth and nutty, and regular so Delicious both tastes smooth and somewhat coconutty.

My only issue is that the calories are a bit high and the nutrients a bit low.  Each (appx) 5x3\" cracker is 70 calories and has only 2 grams of fiber.

I and a daughter have gone through 4 boxes at this point and this is what I've found:<br /><br />Taste is like those huge pillows of shredded wheat cereal pounded down into a hard, thick crackery crispbread.  Not even close to the amount of seeds in the picture and maybe 1 or 2 currants per crispbread.  The added brown sugar gives it the allusion of being sweetened with currants when they are so \"absent\" that the sweetness is definitely the sugar.  I've found 1, possibly 2 currants per cracker.  Needed at least a tiny bit of sodium as is lacking in taste.  It's much more blackened..much...than the picture which I suppose hides the fact it has very few seeds.<br /><br />It tastes best microwaved for about 15 to 20 seconds then covered with a thin layer of cream cheese.  Doing this makes it a tasty treat.  But then covering anything in cream cheese makes it a tasty treat.

      "Review: I can't stand false advertising >:-(<br />The crackers are two mostly plain solid layers with stuff in between. I think there may be some seedy and fruity things inside, in between the layers...not really consistent fruit 'filling', but just randomly distributed small fruit/seed bits. Cracker tastes good when your bite happens to catch a fruit thing, but that happens like 3x per a cracker.  (Each cracker is the size of a regular index card.)<br /><br />Basically, CRACKERS ARE NOT SINGLE LAYER COVERED BY TONS OF SEEDS AND FRUIT BITS like you see in the picture!!!  Don't expect that!<br /><br />With that said, they weren't that bad.  NOT sweet (unfortunately), and taste kinda fibery.  Pretty regular dry healthy crackers.  They are not filling, unless you tend to be filled up by index-card sizes of crispy dry whole wheat bread.  But they may help curb your appetite for a short while?<br />I enjoyed them of cheese and honey on top :-) Yummy.<br /><br />Summary:<br />- cracker= 2plain layers with very little fruit/seed bits in between<br />- feels healthy<br />- tastes okay.\n",

      "Review: This really knocks you out and gives you great sleep without feeling any hangover. It's amazing. (It's also quite tasty, kinda like Snapple only if you drink too much you turn into Rip Van Winkle.) A family member recommended it and I'm glad I tried it. I wish it wasn't so expensive and more available though. Often, Amazon is out of stock and nowhere else on their website is listed as a seller.<br /><br />Update: I've noticed that since I started drinking this every once in a while when I have sleep issues, even if months have lapsed at a time, I've become more tolerant to the effects of the drink. (I found this, also, when I took Valerian pills directly. Valerian root is one of the ingredients.) So one bottle or two doesn't really put me to sleep anymore. This might just be me but I'd suggest not using it too often to avoid becoming tolerant. Just use it when you really need it...which I do but I tend to become tolerant to things very quickly. I wouldn't mind if the cost wasn't so exorbitant. Drinking two bottles a night can become pretty pricey if I'm having a week of insomnia. The thing is despite the price this does really beat the side effects of a lot of the sleep aids out there and trust me, I've tried A LOT of them. This is great for once in a while when your sleep schedule gets out of whack.<br /><br />Also, I discovered that Walmart sells the drink for $20! And it ships free if you purchase more than $45 so it's worth going over to Walmart to get 3 cases at a time.\n",

I always liked thick shakes growing up so I thought it might be a way to make a sensible shake or smoothie with the body of a more indulgent drink. Guess what  -  it's amazing! It does the job to the nth degree. With the addition of about half a teaspoon you can make a fat free shake that almost refuses to pour out of the blender. I wouldn't reccommend any more than half a teaspoon to start because you can always add more liquid. I did that and wound up with a full blender full of drink and it was still almost too thick to pour. It's also very popular in salad dressings because it adds body and cling.

I was trying to lower the total cost per loaf, otherwise I might as well buy the loaves in the frozed section which are pretty good. I had already figured out a means to cheaply combine my own flour ingredients so I wouldn't need to purchase the expensive Red Mill gluten free flour. Next, I located on Amazon a great bulk deal on bakers yeast that also added to cost reduction (and was superior in result too.) After buying this Xanthan gum, I further reduced the price per loaf significantly. I have found this product works well and have not noticed any difference in quality of my results with my bread. So, I am very happy to have found this alternative at a more reasonable price.

At least with an unsweetened cereal I can choose to make it sweeter myself. But if it is too sweet out of the box there is no choice to make it less sweet. I contacted the company and told them I didn't like how sweet they had made it now. They denied that they had changed anything. They lost me as a customer after that. I was buying 6 boxes a month for almost 2 years straight. I stopped. I waited a few months and decided to try again to see if they had changed their recipe back the way it used to be. I just opened a new box and it is still sickening sweet for my tastes. Goodbye Nature's Path. If I wanted super sweetened sugar cereal that is what I would have bought! Anybody want free 6 boxes?

And this drink tasted like real ginger and it  was good and strong! Boy, this is a fine soft drink. A bottle has just about the same calories as regular soda and I note 37 grams of sugar.

The splash of red on fresh veggies, lettuce, and other dishes is a treat for the eye as well as the palette. A little salty and acidic, its bright flavor goes great with finished Mexican dishes if you want to kick them up, as well as in soups, beans, chili, and added to salsa when you think it needs a little heat. This sauce is not incredibly hot as some are (the kind that work better as dares, really, or can only be taken in a very diluted form), but it's not for the babies either.<br /><br />It's just right for most people, who like some spice, and putting it on the table lets you make milder dishes, and let the individual diners decide how spicy they want it; likewise, it helps you make those Mexican dishes spicier and tastier if you want to cook with the sauce. The price is great--just over a dollar per bottle, but the large quantity works better for restaurants than individual use.\n",

      "Review: Like the same vendor's Wasabi peas, these peas are use Yellow 5 and Blue 1 dyes to color them. That is a needless addition which no one needs. They also fry these with what they term 'vegetable oil' which according to their package adds about 1.5g of fat per 1 oz serving. Their Wasabi peas are said to use Palm Oil and add 3.1g of fat (almost 1g of saturated fat) per 1oz serving, so I wonder what 'vegetable oil' really means for these peas. Other products from this vendor have nutrition information that is completely wrong (like 0% for everything), so I wonder what really goes into these peas. They are salty and crunchy, but it would be nice if they did not have a bunch of dyes in them and there were clarity about what oil and how much really is in them. Fresh wokked English Peas will be a whole lot better for you, if not a convenient snack at the office...\n",

Boxes stack neatly in the pantry!  No more boxes???  G2 in my store now comes in a slippery plastic cylindrical tube (for more money).  Doesn't stack in the pantry.  Yeah, it's still Gatorade G2 powder, but it's a pain in the posterior.  Packages teeter-totter on the shelf and fall all over the place.  Why do companies like yours screw up a good thing?  Did you feel you needed to make your product look all spacey-agey and better than the other box powders?  Have you tried to put this on your own pantry shelf?  I gave this 2 stars only because it used to be a perfect product.  I've reluctantly moved on to Propel.\n",

      "Review: Thanks a lot, Treat-Umms. Before we discovered your product, we used to sleep in, say, to 7:30 AM or so. Since we have been giving our 6 dogs (5 chihuahuas and a Japanese Chin) Chicken & Sweet Potato Wraps as a morning treat, they have trained us to get up at 5:30 every morning, or earlier, to get their little mouths wrapped around one of these wraps. They are relentless. And of course, being fairly intelligent and trainable, we have complied with their wishes completely. (BTW, one of our chi's has a liver condition, and these treats agree with him just fine.) This product is highly recommended (unless, of course, you value your sleep).<br /><br />Signed, Sleepless in A-town\n",

      "Review: I'm sharing my ultimate chicken recipe secret here...Preheat oven, 350. Crush Kashi Warm Cinnamon Oat Cereal between two sheets of wax paper. Then, after dipping skinless, boneless, chicken breasts in Almond Milk, I roll each chicken piece in the Kashi crumbs, then dust pieces with paprika (or cayenne if you like the heat) and garlic powder. (I do this in two steps because I omit paprika and garlic powder on a couple of pieces for my Grandson) The combination is to die for. Spritz with EVOO, oven bake as you usually do for oven fried chicken. While the chicken bakes, put 4 T. coconut oil on a cookie sheet and place on empty, lower rack in oven. Slice 5 washed yams in 1/4 inch diagonal slices. Remove the warm cookie sheet and toss yams in melted coconut oil. Return yams to oven. Yams will be done about the same time as chicken...but check so they don't become mushy. You will love this chicken, if you love cinnamon, and the yams are better than candy. Hope it makes your day.\n",

      "Review: This is my favorite tea. Very strong Bergamot aroma, and the tea is very fresh (I just drank a cup this morning from a bag I bought in January and it's not stale yet!). The silk bags allow really fast and thorough steeping. Shipping was super quick, and I love that the sachets are all in a single, resealable bag, rather than individually packaged. Less packaging=less to throw away. These are 2-cup sachets, but I use them in regular mugs, just being sure to only steep it for a few minutes. Sometimes I get a second cup out of a sachet if I save it (I'm not a purist, I just like tea!), but if you have a 2-cup teapot these are perfect for that, too.<br /><br />I bought the 50-pack in January and I need to buy another one real soon.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just bought another pack, plus one of the Chocolate Mint, and it's just as high quality as the last.

I am very disappointed Kellogg's FiberPlus® Berry Yogurt Crunch cereal.  First it tastes similar to Sugar Frosted Flakes....way too sweet. Second, I eat a lot of 'rival' high fiber cereals and they do what they are supposed to do. Not this one.  And the product labelling is do I dare say a lie.  Misleading the public. 10g of fiber is 40% of 25.  10g of Fiber is not 40% of 28 or 35.  USDA recommends 28g per day.  Kelloggs has decided to change how many calories are recommended each day for an adult.  They changed it from 2500 to 2000.  Why. What do you think. I can think of at least three reasons.  I do not purchase Kellogg cereal and after this, never will again.\n",

What I received instead<br />was a blue mylar-fused zip-top bag. Those are harder to seal and keep fresh,<br />in my experience.<br /><br />Then the item itself. Sure, I read the reviews. At some point, food and treats are<br />food and treats, and you hope your cat will eat them. Well, count two cats here who<br />could not care less!  I shook some out on the floor. Both looked at me like I had<br />littered, and missed the trash can! There was cautious sniffing and walking away.<br />I ended up having to vacuum it up off the floor later.<br /><br />Now, I know it is a myth that cats adore fish. It's a cute story, and the fish bones<br />are just so darned cute when the graphic artists draw things about cats. The truth is that<br />most cats prefer some sort of poultry, and eat birds and mice - not fish. Few cats live<br />in the water, and even fewer own fishing rods! ;  )  They do not regularly attempt to eat<br />fish. (They do, however, love trying to catch the small ones in aquariums, just like they<br />would like to catch any moving object.)

      "Review: These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.

      "Review: Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.<br /><br />The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!\n",

They are rich in vitamin E, magnesium and calcium while only being 170 calories for one serving.  They also add 3 grams of dietary fiber to your diet and 6 grams of protein while only adding 2 grams of sugar.<br /><br />They do contain 15 grams of fat but only 1 gram of saturated fat and 0 grams of trans fat. (Mostly they are the good stuff)  If you want a quick snack that is high in protein and low in sugar and sodium these are pretty good and spicy.<br /><br />While there are other flavors that I like more this one is still very good.  Just remember, they are addictive so you only get one serving!\n",

      "Review: I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!\n",

I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!\n",

The flavor's great and the almonds are fresh, but somehow the texture just fails. The almonds just seem... soggy. They don't have that wonderful crunch that the other Blue Diamond flavors have. And that flattens out the whole experience of eating them. I've eaten about 10 bags so far, and they all have the same lackluster texture.<br /><br />Oh well.

      "Review: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word \"Bold\" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a \"Bold\" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!\n",

      "Review: My dog was recently diagnosed with kidney disease and the vet recommended the k/d diet.  I bought a 5lb bag at the vet's office for $32.00 of Hill's Prescription K/D dry dog food.  The vet told me that there were different brands and I'd have to experiment to find out which one my dog would like.  Not knowing that I would need a prescription for such dog food I went home without a prescription.<br /><br />My dog seemed to like the food - so knowing that a 5lb bag wouldn't last long I went in search of this special dog food. I went from store to store trying to find the k/d diet dog food.  I quickly found out I would need a prescription - of which the vet had to mail to me.  Even with the prescription you can only buy this special dog food from a vet's office.  Well for me - that's totally inconvenient.  My vet's office is a 1/2 hour drive away and with my work schedule and kids - it's not always convenient to drive for an hour just to get dog food.<br /><br />At one store I found the Hi-Tor Neo Diet food which could be bought without a prescription.  The clerk there was exetremely knowledgable and helpful.  She told me that the Hi-Tor Neo Dog food was actually better than the Hill's Prescription k/d.  I thought I  would try it since the 10lb bag was $24.99.  My dog loved it!  The clerk told me that they might not carry this brand for much longer so I went on the internet and found that Amazon carries this product. Even with shipping I'll be saving more than half of what I would spend at the vet's for a 10lb bag - not to mention the cost of gas and my time for a round trip.  I compared the labels and I do believe that Hi-Tor is actually better than the prescription brand.  In short, it's better for my dog, my dog likes it, I don't need a prescription and it's half the price with more convenience than the other dog food - what's not to love about it?\n",

The only reason I order is that I don't have time to go buy these at a local store which is about an hour from my house--thus ordering makes sense. Except that when my shipment arrives there are 3 packages out of the 6 boxes that are leaking. I open up the box and there is a terrible stench. Spoiled coconut water smells awful, especially in the 100 degree summer temps we've been having. So I unpack the boxes, and pour out the spoiled contents because of the smell, and then go to Amazon to try to report that 3 out of the 6 boxes in the package were damaged. Well, it looks like the only option is to return the package or request a refund. I need the other 3 boxes that were not leaking, and can't find an option to report this to anyone. Then I read the other reviews for this product and note that I'm not the only one whose experienced issues with leaking during shipment. Since there doesn't appear to be a way to be credited for only the items in the shipment that were leaking, and keep the others, and I would have had to get clean boxes and repack the horrible smelling boxes in new packaging to ship back, I just decided to keep the undamaged ones, and to let others know. I won't be ordering this size again in the future, and will just make the one hour trip to my grocer that carries the larger size and then buy locally in bulk next time.<br /><br />Note: if you try the product it is really good, but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired.\n",

I truly feel there is no better coconut water than the one that comes directly from the source in hand.  Because fresh coconuts are not easy to find I started buying Vita Coco over a year ago.  From all other coconut waters out there I felt theirs was the best tasting, best quality and I also liked the fact that the source of the water came from just one country and not multiple ones.  I have been a happy consumer for over a year, most of my purchases came from the local supermarket until I decided to purchase the vita coco 6 pack on Amazon as part of the subscribe and save program I gave a box to my mother in law. Earlier this week she opened one of the containers and she said the taste seemed a bit off, a little rancid and she felt like I had swallowed something more than just water. She decided to take a closer look and I was appalled at what she uncovered. Huge chunks of mold her water; it made her sick to her stomach. I am sad to say that after this experience we will no longer consume this product. My concern is what kind of quality control is out there and is this the first incident.  I have heard many reviews talking about rancid taste and moldy taste I wonder how many of those containers had the same stuff inside.  Worse of all is that I have been giving this water to my 3 year old who loves coconut water. My mother in law sealed the container and took these pictures I have contacted the company but I have yet to hear from anyone.\n",

The taste is light, refreshing and hardly sweet at all. And yes, it is thirst-quenching. However, I do not recommend this larger packaging size. The other tetra packaging for the smaller individual cartons is better equipped for impact. Since I lost much of the drink from the leakage on both orders, I cannot give a high rating.

      "Review: Amazon.com packed this product very well and the package was not damaged during shipment.<br /><br />The Vito Coco product I ordered and received (as titled) was not as good condition.  On 4 of the 34 oz boxes, the seals were broke slightly.  All 4 with broken seals were dripping very slightly - very noticeable as I held onto them.  The slight pressure used to hold them caused the dripping out of the seal before ever removing the seal. Two of the containers was smashed on the top - both of which were 2 of the 4 with broken seals. When I opened some of the shipping packages of these products, it smelled moldy.<br /><br />The seal for the opening is flimsy and could easily be damaged. Some of the seals were far too easy to remove - not the kind of seal you want to use for this heavy weight - 34 oz product.<br /><br />I only have one other coconut water to compare this product to, and that is the brand O.N.E.  Compared to O.N.E., the taste of this product was off - a taste of decay or mold. Some tasted moldier than others. I drank them all anyway (with no apparent ill affects), except for 3 of the 4 in which the seals were broken.  3 of the 4 with broken seals, I poured down the drain.<br /><br />The price of the 34 oz 6 pack product of Vita Coco is excellent in comparison to other coconut water brands on the market, but is it worth it?  Not to me.  I will not be buying this product again unless they improve IF the price remains the same.\n",

      "Review: First, let me note that there are several different manufacturers of these 1 liter bottles of coconut water. I have tried this variety (Vita Coco) and the Zico brand, which were comparable in price and quality. Both were delicious, though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion. So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.<br /><br />I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold. As they claim, it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).<br /><br />But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories. One can of coke (12 fl. oz) = ~143 calories (according to the label, other sites claim more).

When I first found VitaCoco all i could think was these guys are geniuses and somehow managed to create a coconut drink that actually tastes like the real coconut.

I checked and it appears to be something wrong with their peal back seals rather than the boxes themselves and I will be calling the company so they can address their faulty packaging since it's not Amazon. The drink itself is better than a few that I've tried thus far. I mix them with protein powder after the gym or sip them on their own. Very tasty. Better than Zico which tasted strange to me.<br /><br />If you order it and get a pack that leaks, call the company and complain. They need to know from anyone who has a leaking product that their product is faulty. It's not amazon as the foil seal on the boxes wasn't secure. In fact, I'll be raising issues of product tampering as a safety issue.<br /><br />The drink itself is great. The packaging not so much.\n",

      "Review: I reluctantly give this a 3 due mainly to the smell of the Liver Flavor.  The sole purpose of the product is to offer a flavorful break from the ordinary dog food flavors they normally receive but alas both picky Yorkies refused on several occasions to even take a good whiff.  They love freeze dried livers from chickens, beef, pig and lamb but cannot stand Lickety Stik.  Just to test the situation I tried the Stik first and it was a resounding NO.  Then after they had freeze dried livers and again it was NO.  I took their favorite dry food and applied a small amount on several pieces and mixed them in with untreated food.  They literally segregated the morsels into edible and Stiks.  The Stiks did not get touched while the unflavored were eaten with vigor.  Determined to prove that the Yorkies are just picky I offered a few licks to the neighbor's Retriever and he looked at me as if I am the fool I am.  Success did not open its heart on several days ago nor did it when I tried one more time with the same negative results.  I cannot say that any of the other flavors have any similar aspects since I only received the one container.  Bottom line:  Human Rating: 3  Dog Rating: 1 too many.

We got the liver flavor and all the dogs loved it.  In fact, there was some times when two dogs were trying to lick the roller at the same time since they can't seem to wait their turn.  It's definitely something to try...don't know how well it would do training your dog instead of the regular treats, though.  It'll probably get gross after a few lickings too but a damp paper towel should fix it up...especially if you wipe it after the dog uses it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't comment if it really tastes like liver flavor.

She's a big dog, which usually means they'll eat anything, but not my dog, so when I got her the Likety Stik, I honestly didn't think she'd like it, but she loved it!  And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.<br /><br />I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.<br /><br />I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.

      "Review: My little diabetic shih-tzu, Lily, is notorious for hating anything new. I am constantly on the search for healthy new treats that I can give her after she has her insulin shot (every 12 hours...ugh!) I received the Liver flavor Lickety Stik and was prepared to donate it to the local animal shelter because I was just sure Lily would turn up her nose to it. Lo and behold...she liked it! It took a minute or two for her to figure out how to get the treat out and I squeezed the bottle too hard and some dripped on the floor, but Lily quickly lapped it up. I don't think the ball turned very easily, but she was determined to try to get the treat-juice out of the bottle. I think this is a great idea, but I am only giving it 4 stars because the packaging was hard to read and the ball didn't seem to turn very readily.\n",

      "Review: I have one dog, Rex, a Shepherd/Lab mix and he absolutely loves the Lickety Stik. Now if he sees me get it out, he automatically sits or gives me his paw. So cute.<br /><br />This is a great new idea for doggy treats. Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)\n",

      "Review: Really like the idea of a roller-ball to give treats, especially as rewards when training (skateboard, leash walking and close commands).  The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.  Lickety Stik is a healthy all natural (according to the ads) liquid containing vitamins and low in calories in several flavors. The dispenser contains over 500 licks.  A no mess way to give rewards plus it carries the made in the USA with all-natural ingredients.  My English Bulldog puppy loves the stuff (liver flavor); however, it also comes in chicken and bacon flavors. Following  is a list for those who read the ingredients,  1)natural liver flavors, (2) cultured milk, (3) lecithin, (4) mixed tocopherols (natural preservative- a source of vitamin E), (5) scorbyl palmitate (source of vitamin C), (6) rosemary extract, (7) green tea extract.  A caution about dogs allergic to chicken - they should not be licking this stuff. Unlike most treats, the shelf life is 18 months and \"best\" licked by date is stamped on the bottom of the roll-on dispenser. The description indicates the Lickety Stik formula contains antimicrobial agents - basically no germ transfer. The stuff does not have to be refrigerated.  Naturally, you must shake the dispenser often.  Will be ordering the Lickety Stik 3 pack with all flavors from Amazon.  \"Reilly\" recommends the treat!\n",

      "Review: I had to give the ball a partial turn to get some of the liquid on it after shaking to mix it up, but after I did that my dog licked away and loved it! This is a good low-cal treat for dogs and would be great as a training aid. Our dog dutifully performed her repertoire of tricks to get more of the treat, and then followed me back to the kitchen as I put it away. The only bad thing is that you DO have to hold it for the dog, but if you're using it as a training aid that may actually be an advantage.<br /><br />There are over 500 licks in each tube and 10 licks is only 1 calorie. I gave my dog 10 licks per trick.<br /><br />FWIW, my dog is a 1.5 year old hound dog/bird dog mutt.\n",

      "Review: The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're \"healthier;\" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that.\n",

That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times, then immediately wanted to chew on the roller.  I repeatedly pulled it out each time he'd try, but it kept repeating.  Lick, lick, lick, chew.  Lick, lick, lick chew.  Within one minute, no exaggerating, he had chewed off the end and I was scared to death that he'd swallow the roll ball. Fortunately he spit it out, but if he had swallowed it, he easily could have choked to death on it with it blocking his windpipe.  I would never buy this product again, and highly recommend others not to.  Seriously, it was completely chewed through in one minute of opening the package.\n",

      "Review: I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping. When the PetSafe Lickety Stik (essentially the same design as a roll-on deodorant) popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched one up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently.\n",

      "Review: This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could \"train\" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that.\n",

      "Review: We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary.\n",

      "Review: I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is \"Smoky Bacon\"<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the \"no mess\" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only \"outside\" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product.\n",

Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by.

As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy.\n",

      "Review: I have three dogs. Two of them loved it, one so much that she tried to swallow the whole bottle, or run away with it and rip into it as she might a bone. They were definitely confused by it, they weren't sure what to do with it, but once they caught the smell of bacon they couldn't get enough. The third wasn't so keen on it, but I feel like that was more because he was abused before we took him in and he doesn't like something being held in front of his face like you have to do with this treat. I did eventually get him to try some, but after one lick he refused anymore, I will attribute this to his fear rather than any misgivings he might've had about taste as he eats everything.<br /><br />I think this would work better if you have just one dog. When you pass out treats or food, sometimes squabbles can happen, and that definitely happens here when you're focus is on just one dog and the others get jealous. Also, dogs generally do prefer to grab their treat then be able to go, take it somewhere and spend some time with it, maybe hide it for later, can't really do that with this.<br /><br />This is also drippy, so be careful or you could end up with a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this would work for training though. I would probably stick with regular treats for that, but if anyone can test that, please comment and let us know if it worked!<br /><br />Edit: I noticed that my dogs try to go after pill bottles now because the bottles kind of looks like the tube (have a similar shape) so if you get this, might want to watch out for that.\n",

The odor wafted off the stick and filled the room like a musky air freshener. We called it \"Icky Stik\" or \"Stinky Stik\" as the experience was so nauseating that no one volunteered to reopen the stick, despite pleas from our dogs.<br /><br />We tested the PetSafe Lickety Stik as part of the Amazon Vine program, which is to say the product arrived free. The company sent us the Savory Chicken flavor and we tested it with our Cockapoo and Miniature Schnauzer, both adult females. Neither dog had trouble figuring out how to advance the roller ball so they could taste the liquid. One warning: if you get this stuff on your hands you'll play heck trying to wash it off.<br /><br />A collective shudder ran through the family as we wondered: if Savory Chicken smells this bad, can you imagine inhaling a deep whiff of \"Braised Liver\" or \"Smoky Bacon\"? Worse yet, the company touts the product's portability and recommends carrying it in your purse. That's a bit risk since this stuff in the bottle is hardly perfume.<br /><br />The company says Lickety Stick consists of all-natural ingredients.

      "Review: This product is really dumb and pointless. My dog was simply not interested, and I was not interested in holding it in my hand while she licked it. When I ordered it, I thought I was getting something you could just give the dog, and she would entertain herself for a long time, by licking. It sounded like a good idea because my dog really likes to lick things. I give her something lick-able when I want her to go lay down and be quiet. This product is useless for that purpose. This is an interactive treat. You and your dog both have to interact with it. It gets old, pretty much immediately.<br /><br />The product itself is gross. It's sticky and unappealing. The smell is nauseating. My dog would take a sniff, and sometimes a trial lick, and then just walk away. I'd be left standing there holding a phallic shaped bottle of mysterious smelly goo.<br /><br />Here are some things my dog likes better than Lickety Stiks: dirty diapers, dead pigeons, week-old garbage, and other dog's butts.<br /><br />The only people who really enjoyed the product are the teenagers in my house, who think \"Lickety Stik\" is possibly the most hilarious product name they ever heard. The jokes lasted most of the afternoon. The packaging offers plenty of crude suggestions (\"give a lick\" tm  they trademarked that??), as if my kids needed any encouragement. Even the shape of the bottle - a rigid cylinder with a ball on top - was fodder for hilarity. They thought it was just so funny.<br /><br />So this is a stupid product with a funny name and a suggestive shape, which solves no problems, has no appeal beyond comedy, and is completely worthless.\n",

At first glance you would almost assume it is roll-on deodorant, but then you see the picture of the dog in the middle of the bottle, so you know it can't be.<br /><br />But I did try giving this to all 3 of my dogs. None of them knew what to do with it and seemed aggrevated when they licked the ball and nothing would come out. I then figured out I had to squeeze the bottle to make the contents drip out. When I did that, they stopped licking, looked at the ball, took one whiff and turned their noses up in the air as if to say \"ewwww get this thing outta my face right now\"!!<br /><br />I find that dogs (mine anyway) like to chew, so they kinda don't know what to do with this odd invention. They aren't rabbits who drink water from a water bottle. This reminded me of something like that. This is for an animal who is used to licking from a rolling ball. You can't exactly give it to a dog, then let them go off on their own with it like a normal treat or a bone, because rather than licking the ball, they would want to investigate what it's made of and would chew it to bits until the contents fell out. In my opinion, not a very good idea and could potentially be very dangerous. I really don't see the point in this item at all, unless of course you are a rabbit.\n",

      "Review: I decided to try this \"treat\" with my new dog. I am trying to teach her different responses and thought that a treat that did not add calories to her diet would be a good idea.<br /><br />I introduced the treat to her and she ignored it at the beginning. The shape of the container is of one of the old fashioned roll-on deodorants. I moved the ball around to get some of the liquid on it and re-introduced it to my dog. She liked the flavor but was frustrated with it as the ball gets stuck. She tried a few times and ended up yanking the container from my hand and running away with it.<br /><br />She is a very fast dog and when I caught up with her she had managed to rip the ball of the container. Lucky for me she did not swallow the ball as I think it could have killed her. I picked up the ball and threw it away. I could not get container from her as she was busy using it as a chew toy.<br /><br />I will not be buying this product for her as it is hard to use and I do not think that she should be chewing on plastic. The contents were delicious to her as they were a chicken based.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product.\n",

      "Review: Well when I ordered this product for my dogs I had high hopes that this would be something that they might like.  The concept is that the product looks like a deodorant roll on...if you remember those.  You take the top off, and then there is a roll over which the gravy-like product is dispensed.  The gravy is thick and difficult to get to start dispensing.  Once it does start coming out of the sides of the roller ball, the process of it coming out is inconsistent.  Sometimes it comes out slowly,  then sometimes you have to shake the bottle a  good bit to encourage the gravy to come out around the roll.  This usually means that you are having to futz around with this dog treat much more than you would like to have to.  The dogs also got a little discouraged with the process as well.  They would actually walk off and give up on me with a frustrated look on their face as if to say that this was hardly worth it.\n",

What I received is one lick stick, not three. My Dobie loves Bacon and Liver so I was really looking forward to receiving both and figured he may be interested in the chicken as well. When I opened the envelope and saw just one lick thing I looked at the shipping invoice and it said that the one stik was bacon flavor. So, although puzzled at the lack  of the other two stiks I figured that at least he was getting to lick one of his favorite flavors. Not to be. The tiny bottle, about the size and apprearance of a small roll-on deodorant stick, was labeled \"Savory Chicken Flavor\". I figured I would give it a try and held it for my Dobie to lick. He gave me a scornful look indicating that he failed to find it \"Savory\" and walked away. I tried several more times but he began to give me a look that meant his patience was running thin. He is a large Dobie and very strong so I heeded his message and apologized by giving him a treat that ensured his forgiveness. The lack of receiving three sticks, the shipping invoice labeled as bacon flavored and the actual tiny bottle of disgusting chicken something are all a mystery to me.\n",

Only instead of fresh-scented anti-persperant, it was drippy, smelly, bacon-flavored dog juice.<br /><br />So I guess you're supposed to stoop down and hold the roll-on bottle in front of the dog while it licks the roller ball to get the dog juice on its tongue. You're supposed to do this without yacking from the smell. Meanwhile, there's a million dog treats out there that you can throw to the dog and he runs off and eats it and you're not doing deep knee bends to apply dog juice roll-on to your dog's already funky tongue.<br /><br />To say nothing of the fact that the dog just wants to take it and bite it.

      "Review: I am a veterinarian with 7 years experience, and I have 3 Great Danes.  I am always looking for safe, effective, fun, and innovative new pet products.  I saw the video for this product, and definitely agree that carrying a pocketful of crumbling treats isn't much fun for training/rewards, so decided to give it a try.  All 3 of my girls tried to bite the bottle at first (and I think most dogs will), but within a few seconds, all of them figured it out, and were licking away very happily, each taking their turn sitting down for me.  I also recently used it to help keep them standing still while my 8 year old daughter gave them baths outside with the hose on a nice warm day....much less mess than doing it in the tub inside!  It was also handy when we went for a short hike at a local park a while back, as I am training the 2 younger Danes to wear backpacks (that's a whole other story!).  Even if the dogs jump in the river wearing their backpacks and get them soaked, their treats won't get soggy.  The only thing I would like to see is using a liquid treat that's maybe a bit healthier for them...the ingredient list on the Lickety Stik looks like a lot of processed stuff.  It does have a bit of an odor, too, but I didn't find it that strong or offensive like some of the other people here did.  And I think it's the odor that really draws the dogs to come check it out...otherwise, why would they want to just lick a plastic roller ball?<br />Also, I think it would be nice to have a bottle that is just a little bit larger for the large/giant breeds like mine...but this does work well regardless.  Finally, I think it would be great to have a refillable bottle, so there would be less waste...500 licks goes fast when you're training 3 big dogs!<br />Oh, and yes, I will re-order this, and do recommend it.\n",

      "Review: I thought this looked interesting a liquid dog treat what? So I purchased it, I have two small dogs a seven year old Yorkie and a seven month old puppy Bichon Frise/ Toy Poodle mix. Well I showed it to the puppy I got the liver flavor it does smell bad and let him sniff it he went wild and starting jumping towards my hand trying to get it and barking like crazy I told him sit and paw and he did  and I give him a lick he loved it. Now my Yorkie sniffed it and walked away but she is extremely picky about her treats so it did not surprise me at all. I love how this is small can fit in a jacket and is about the length of your hand opened, this is low in calories 1 calorie in 10 licks and the bottle has 500 licks! this is great I clicker train my puppy and he knows a bunch of tricks but I always felt Like I was filling him up with a ton of treats and then would have to feed him less dinner and I felt bad. But with this I no longer have to worry now it can be messy if your not careful don't squeeze too hard, I will definitely be getting more of this and trying it in different flavors for my Pup Mozart. This is also great for teaching small dogs to heel to stay by your left side and it is great to use outside when the puppy gets distracted by people or other dogs kids etc I can refocus his attention on me and get him to calm down.\n",

My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this again.\n",

It worked but it was very messy. Lickety Stik works much better, although I do generally need a helper to hold it while I groom. The big test will come when I next take him to the vet and bring LS along--will it work the same while he's getting his temperature taken? Or will the experience of the thermometer ruin the treat for him? If the former, I'm sure all the vets and techs at our clinic will be ordering this stuff! I was a little concerned with the stuff upsetting my dogs' digestive systems: the new guy has an  iron gut it seems but my other dog has a sensitive tummy. She, however, had some (inserted herself while I was grooming the newbie) and was o.k. We were using liver flavor. Overall, I'm very impressed so far and ordering some more.\n",

After surfing the internet we found numerous other claims with people having the same issue- some even needing to spend a few thousand on procedures to remove the ball.

      "Review: My dogs seem to find Likety Stik extremely tasty as demonstrated by their desire to keep licking it. On my part, however, there are some reservations.  I have the liver flavor and for one, it is one of the worst smelling doggie treats that I have.  Not too sure if people want to carry this around in their purse. The stick works like a rollerball, like some of the anitperspirants you see out on market.  When you first open, it does not roll very easily, but eventually it will get going after your dog licks it a few times.  The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.  This may be prevented by having certain chemicals present that inhibit this possibility, but then it loops back to my concern of feeding these to my dog.  Although novel, I don't really see a benefit of having this as a treat other than the caloric count.\n",

      "Review: I came across this PetSafe Lickety Stik and decided to give it a try.  We just got an 8 week old Bassett Hound puppy and decided to try out this Lickety Stik as a training reward due to its low calorie content.  Bassets are know to get fat quick so a low calorie reward is needed as Bassetts basically only respond to food.<br /><br />Basically, this thing has the same construction as a stick of roll-on deodorant.  You turn it upside down, the liquid inside saturates the ball in a second or so and your dog takes a lick or two of the ball.  It works fantastically for training a puppy or dog.  We got the bacon flavor and she absolutely loves it.<br /><br />The puppy loves it and will do anything to get a lick of this thing.  It smells terrible to us(a really disguisting rancid bacon odor)but she absolutely adores it.  The price of $8 may seem a little high, but we've have been using the same Stik for over a month now, numerous times each day and we still have a third of it left.  We will definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a fantastic product that is great for training or just a treat.  Highly recommended!\n",

      "Review: As other reviewers have mentioned, this looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant. It's not quite what I was expecting. You have to squeeze it a little to get the liquid to flow, and then the dog can lick at the roller ball, similarly to how a hamster would drink from its water bottle. It works well enough, and my dog likes the taste okay. It seems to bother her that she can't chew on it, and it bothers me that I can't just hand it to her and let her go to town on it. Yes, it's convenient and non-messy to carry around. For my dog, the low-calorie aspect isn't necessarily a good thing. For example, when I take her on a hike, she runs around like crazy, so I actually want her to get some calories from her treats. The other times I give her treats, I'm usually giving her something chewy that will help remove dental plaque. So overall, this isn't a great option for my particular dog. If your dog has a weight problem and you like to give it treats, this is probably a good alternative for you. This isn't something that I'll purchase again myself.\n",

      "Review: I have two dogs, one Black Labrador and one Chihuahua.  The Lab can't get enough of this stinky treat and even tries to grab it from me with her teeth.  She will lick on it all day if I let her. The Chihuahua sniffs it and snubs it. She couldn't be less interested. So, one out of two dogs loves this stinky treat.  Humans, on the otherhand, hate the strong smell.  I think it's fun and can imagine it is a great treat substitute for obese dogs who need to watch their calorie intake. If you aren't adverse to strong odors you'll love the handiness of this Lickety Stik!\n",

I have 3 dogs and all three of them liked the taste of it.  I like it because it seems like a more personal treat than just a dog biscuit.  I recommend this!\n",

      "Review: I am of the curious sort when it comes to dog treats and new ways to reward dogs so I jumped at getting this product.<br /><br />Lickety Stick arrived and three dogs were eagerly sitting in front of me; a cocker spaniel, a norwegian elkhound, and an australian shepherd.<br /><br />I unwrapped the stick and squeezed a little juice out of the tube onto the roller. I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer. I don't see myself buying these in the future.\n",

      "Review: My little dog (a Shih Tzu) seemed to have trouble licking the rollerball consistently enough to fully enjoy the treat.  Her inclination was to try to bite the top - and I'm wondering if that's what most dogs would try to do.  Of course, a dog can't tell you in words if they like something - you have to go by behavior.  And when we took this away from our dog, she really didn't protest like she does when it is a favorite treat.<br /><br />The premise behind this product is interesting - and I can understand why the idea of a rollerball made sense.  I'm just not sure it all works together well enough.  I can't envision seeking this out and purchasing it for my pet.\n",

      "Review: What a great idea for a treat.  Lickety Stik is constructed like a roll-on deodorant with a flavored dog treat inside.  Hold the Stik upside down and my dog licked away at it.  It is low calorie (great for my dog who is on a diet). It is also very easy to carry.  I keep it in my pocket.Since it has a cap and has plastic construction, it doesnt get crushed in my pocket. It makes a great little reward during training sessions.<br /><br />I find it especially helpful to reward my dog when Im teaching him a new trick. With the lickey stik he was very eager to see the stik come out.<br /><br />A few notes on the Lickety Stik's use.  The first time you use the Lickety stik, you may have to move the roller-ball with your fingers to get the treat to flow a little.  Once the dog understands that licking the ball makes the treat flow, it is not an issue. Also when he is done licking, there is no dripping.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik also has a clear window at the base of of the bottle so you know when it is time to reorder.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik is not large which makes it easy to trasport. However it does mean that if it is your primary treat for you dog, you may run out quickly.<br /><br />Overall, I can say that the dog was enthusiastic about the stick. It was easy to use. It was fun to give. I am happy with this product.\n",

      "Review: The Lickety Stik is fabulous!  My dog immediately took to it and gets so excited when he sees the bottle.  I have been trying to train him to fetch a ball and then give it back to me, but I have had to wrestle the ball away from him.  I was worried about giving him too many treats because of calories, not to mention the expense.  I started letting him lick the Stik once or twice each time I got the ball away from him.  It didn't take long before he would drop the ball when he saw the Stik, and now he puts it directly into my hand, just so he can lick the Stik. I plan on using it to train him to do other things, as well.<br /><br />Considering how many times I have used it, it is a good value for the money.  It's kind of awkward to give him as a regular dog treat, so I save it for training and give him dog biscuits or other treat.\n",

Rather than lick this \"roll-on\" treat, she would rather just bite it and chew it. That's really the only down side. Found out my daughters kitten liked it too. It's weird, like a 1980's deodorant company trying to do something profitable with their out of date product line. I wouldn't buy it, but my pets liked it.\n",

      "Review: Well, when I ordered this I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it sure wasn't a roll on deodorant container filled with stinky liver flavored liquid.  For me personally, I've always stood by the belief that while the dogs are the one enjoying the dog toys and treats, the are more made for the humans than anything else and there is something totally repugnant about a dog eating from a deodorant container.<br /><br />Jilly, my puppy, loved it.  She kept on trying to take it out of my hand and bite at the container until she realized she had to lick but she did love the flavor.  The only real negative is that Jilly got \"liver breath.\"  Also the ball in the container didn't spin and I had to squeeze and I got a drip or two on the floor.  I have wood floors so no harm no foul, but if you have carpeting you might get a stain, but Jilly helped with the clean up.<br /><br />But I couldn't quite get over the container and even though Jilly loved it the doggy breath and the fact I didn't like her licking a deodorant container was a big turn off.  Plus, if I used roll on deodorant I won't want my dog to associate it with treats, in case she got in the bathroom and ate the real deodorant which I'm sure could make her very sick.<br /><br />3 Stars.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The cat found this on the table and started pawing at it, so I opened it for her so she could have a lick and she loves it more than the dog!\n",

This became the pattern -- place thumb on ball, roll, let dogs lick off residue, place thumb on ball, roll again ... It became tedious very quickly. My main dog grew impatient and latched onto the bottle with his back teeth, easily piercing the neck allowing the flavored goo to ooze out. I tossed the Lickety Stik lickety split.\n",

      "Review: This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought \"Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!\"\n",

When I eat these in the car I break the package in thirds cross wise (breaking BOTH of the bars), then I go back and break each to those sections in half lengthwise of the package. Then I split the package open the length of its seam and put it where I can reach it. By doing this I generally get 12 fairly uniform pieces and very few crumbs (which I eat later when the car is not moving). This method works well anywhere you want to eat them and definitely seems to generate far fewer crumbs.<br />I ORDERED THESE AS A SUBSCRIPTION JUST BASED ON HOW GOOD ALL THE OTHER FLAVORS OF NATURE VALLEY ARE.<br />NOTE: Another flavor I have never heard of: Vanilla Nut is listed on Amazon as \"out of stock\" with a place you can sign up to be notified when they are again in stock. They've been rated very well by past Amazon Purchasers so I am waiting with a dripping tongue (my dogs taught me that).\n",

      "Review: I first began using the roasted barley to make a beverage almost thirty years ago while learning Hapkido. It is good for the heart, stabilizes the pancreas, and works as a fat emulsifier. It goes well with roasted corn to make an even more healthful drink. I would suggest buying it from a local Korean, Chinese or Japanese market. I just got 4  bags of roasted corn and the roasted barley for less than $9. Then you can either brew it whole on the stove, or grind it and brew it in a French Press. Both ways work well. Adding sugar or honey diminishes some of the health benefits. In spring and summer I have it at room temperature. If it is cold outside I drink it warm. Either way is great. Try 4 tablespoons to a quart of water.\n",

Ran out of real Hoisin Sauce, and because I didn't have the time to go to the local Asian market, I took a chance with Dynasty (got it at Wal-mart).  The best thing I can say about the Dynasty Hoisin Sauce is that it's a small bottle, so I didn't feel too bad throwing it in the trash.  IT IS REALLY BAD!  There's no way anyone who likes to eat yummy food could possibly rate this sauce over 1 star.  I would give it negative stars if I could because I find it offensive to eat food that tastes so wrong.  I'm completely baffled by the 5 star reviews.  TIA?  Stroke?  Alzheimer's?  Tumor?  There's got to be a reason beyond just not knowing any better.

While some dogs go their entire lives scarfing down the fun-to-chew treats, they can be deadly. Rawhides can be full of bacteria and poisons. Aside from what is in rawhide, dogs can choke on them or sustain intestinal blockage from ingesting them.<br /><br />Rawhides often come from less developed countries. This means that the hides are transported over poor roads and without refrigeration, before they cleaned and dried. Under these conditions, they can grow salmonella which can kill your dog. It is also unsafe for humans, especially small children, to handle. The problem has been so serious that in 1999 the FDA to issued a warning on the subject stating \"These products may pose a risk of bacterial infection such as Salmonella...FDA is urging pet owners who have these products to handle them carefully.

If I'm going to use maple syrup, I want that rich, distinctive taste, not something that's barely different than white sugar. That's actually a good comparison - grade A is to grade B as white is to brown sugar. I know we're all used to thinking of \"grade A\" as meaning of superior quality, but that's not how it works with this. It is referring to the level of filtering/processing the sap goes through. If you want generic sweetness, go grade A. For everything else, grade B. This is a trusted brand of organic syrup with a great flavor.

      "Review: Non-GE - \"GE\" stands for genetic engineering and is also referred to as GMO (genetically modified organism). Genetic engineering of food products uses gene splicing to overcome natural boundaries that would otherwise prohibit the creation of a product. Genes from different species can be combined to create a hardier product resistant to certain exogenous factors. As an example, you might be able to add fish genes to corn to make it resistant to pesticides. Although there may be \"instant gratification\" from such benefits as better taste, longer shelf life, and greater yield, serious concerns exist about the long-term ramifications of using these types of products and ingredients. Until more research backing the safety of GE products is available, we'll continue to make every effort to use only non-GE ingredients and products\n",

Their fragile state was probably in part due to the way they were shipped. They were put without any liquid in a tiny, sealed, thin plastic envelope which was placed in an un-padded, business sized letter envelope. The $5.49 shipping seems rather steep for two stamps and a remarkable lack of special packaging. If I had it to do over again I would probably order from somewhere else.

      "Review: I bought grains from the Amazon seller \"Drybyma Treasures\" about a month and a half ago. I received them in 3 days, and they took about 3 days to recover from their ordeal in the mail, producing some very nasty sour-milk-tasting stuff the first day and some very yeasty-tasting stuff the second two days. But their fourth attempt was delicious and by now they've fully recovered and are reproducing like mad. Drybyma sent about 2 tablespoons of grains in the original package, but in a couple of weeks I had half a cup and a week after that I had almost a full cup of grains. I've had to give some grains away and eat some in order to keep the population down.<br /><br />The grains looked like cottage cheese curds when they first arrived. But then they started producing noodle-like shapes and recently began producing tiny cauliflower shapes. It's interesting how they develop.<br /><br />The kefir they produce tastes similar to the kefir I used to buy at my neighborhood Whole Foods store. Sometimes it's more tart than other times, and thickness also varies. I've used both Jersey milk and goat's milk. The thickest, mildest kefir I've made was with raw light cream.<br /><br />Unfortunately Drybyma doesn't seem to be selling kefir grains at the moment. Perhaps they sold out and need to rebuild their stock. Hopefully they'll return so other shoppers can enjoy their product. I can't really rate any other seller's kefir grains because quality can vary.\n",

      "Review: I used organic whole milk** to try to grow the grains from the scant teaspoon I received from the seller. The milk didn't develop a sourish smell, so I guess it stayed fresh, even after 30 days, but I had few and very small--size of uncooked rice--grains. I will stay with the packaged Kefir Starter that I've used for years and which I purchase from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Though I received a couple of pages of instructions from the seller, whose product is shown here at Amazon, those instructions didn't really help me, a novice at growing my own grains. I haven't bothered to contact the seller for help and/or more grains, because it seems a waste of time. I would guess from reading his enclosed instructions that while he tried to be helpful he doesn't really know how to instruct a novice in using the small amount of grains he sent.<br /><br />I am guessing that the pics showing huge grains on websites could just be marketing examples wherein the grower has been using raw milk or something like it. That's just a guess on my part, and if that is the case, it is an example of good marketing, but the sites need to give more-helpful information to the novice.<br /><br />**Perhaps that was my problem? At any rate, I love, love, love kefir as do my kittykats.\n",

It does something--resulting in curds resembling cottage cheese, but so far I see nothing like translucent \"kefir grains\" developing. I have an excellent source of fresh raw cows milk and I've tried 24 and 48 hour culturing.  I've tried draining it using a plastic can colander and straining it in a regular plastic colander.  Maybe kefirs vary from source to source.  I am still new at this.  So far I just mix part of the curds into already made yogurt and put the rest back into the jar to make more of this stuff.

      "Review: I made the mistake of putting too much milk in the jar the first time I made kefir with these grains (old habit) but thought, what the heck, it won't hurt the grains. In 24 hours I strained the milk out of the grains and added just less than a pint (about 12 ounces) of milk to them the second time (I drank the slightly soured milk from the first batch--not bad) Within 24 hours that short pint had turned into the thickest, smoothest, yummiest kefir ever! I've made 2 more batches since and the last one was with 3 cups of milk. Absolutely perfect. I'm convinced that my next batch will do a full quart. Highly recommend this product.<br /><br />PS: I use a low heat pasteurized milk. I would not recommend using regular pasteurized milk and absolutely DO NOT use ultra-pasteurized milk. Raw milk will work but only for the first and maybe second batch as the wild bacteria in the raw milk compete with the kefir grains. If you use raw milk then always let your kefir grains renew themselves in some pasteurized milk.\n",

      "Review: The actual product is fine.  It's recommended by my vet and I gobble it up daily.  I prefer my owner's food but she's stingy with it so I have no choice.  I even enjoy it at times.  My human was thrilled to order it in Feb 2009 and have it show up on our doorstep (no hauling of heavy bag in and out of car) and it was actually slightly cheaper than if she'd bought it from our local pet megalomart chain store.  I don't like the megalomart all that much.  The floors are slippery and they make my nervous.  But then again, I do like to watch the ferrets.  Oh, little ferret, squeeze your squirmy body of of that glass case. I want to play with you soooooo badly......<br />Anyway... my human went to re-order and the price has jumped by $3 and the shipping and handling went from $6.49 to $19.01.  Her yelp of horror scared me out of sound sleep.  I was dreaming of open fields and frisky ferrets.  \"Seriously?\" she screeched? \"The total price jumped from $41.62 to $57.50 in two months time?\"  She's on a rant.  She's going back to the pet megalomart because she can haul her own bag of food for that price.  Oh, all you fine wee ferrets, get ready, I'm coming to seeeeee yooooouuuuuuu!!\n",

      "Review: I would not recommend buying this product because of its large quantities and extremely sweet flavor. Caution: They may not be as healthy as they seem.<br /><br />When I first got these cereal bars I honestly thought they were delicious and great. I ate a couple every few days. It's true that this product would make a great snack or quick breakfast... but only for a short period of time. I soon got tired of these cereal bars and half of the box still exists (it was only me eating them).<br /><br />They are very very sweet and there's more of the sweet jam filling than the multigrain wrap. If you do not have much of a sweet tooth (like me) I do not recommend getting these. And if you really want them, buy the individual boxes in stores. They may be a bit more pricey if you count the individual cost, but you get more choices of flavors and there's only 8 bars per box so you wont end up with a ton left over when you finally get sick of them. And plus, leftover food is still money wasted.<br />Amazon has them but they only sell the boxes in 6 count packs like the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYFCHW\">Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Cherry, 8-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E77LT6\">Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Strawberry, 8-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a> so you still get 48 bars.<br /><br />So I give this product 3 stars.

I bought this oil to be my basic mid-priced olive oil primarily for sauteing. I like all sorts of olive oil -- from soft and buttery to peppery and green. This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings. With other flavorings, the harshness is muted but still remains. In cooked dishes any olive oil flavor mostly disappears. In the same price range, I've had better luck with obscure Spanish or Greek 1 L cans of EVOO from the supermarket.\n",

I was already a big fan of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZU2\">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1-Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and was glad to see an organic version.  Unfortunately, though how much we tried to like this, the organic Zoe Organic EVOO just doesn't taste anywhere near as good as the non-organic variety.  This organic one definitely tastes like it's made from a whole different variety of olives, leaving it with a pronounced sharper, greener flavor with a bit of a bite.  It's very distinct, and totally overpowers my cooking.  The non-organic Zoe EVOO doesn't do this; it blends in perfectly as a marinade, for dipping bread, drizzling as a final touch on cooked dishes, etc.  So, unfortunately, in this case, go with the non-organic, which I have on Subscribe & Save reorder, and is a pantry staple in our house.\n",

First thing I noticed was the viscosity of it, pretty thin.  I don't know if that is good or bad, just an observation.  I figure this is good for salads, and didn't have too much effect on me dipping bread, but would rather have it a bit thick.  The flavor was good, not great.  It didn't have the rich fruity, nutty flavor I was hoping for, but was OK.  I had been using Pompeian and think I prefer its flavor better, at least in dipping.  After I use this up I will go back to Pompeian, its cheap at wmart and to me has the best flavor of any I have tried.  Conclusion is if you want a thin, light oil then this is a good choice, for a more robust flavor, there are better options.\n",

So basically I am thinking ok - I wont be buying this brand again, I'll have to find a new one. Now I am even more upset as I just came on here to write a review and when I search Zoe Olive Oil - the 1 Liter tins came up - but are no longer on S&S <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060JNAE8\">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1 Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and they are 50 cents more than the 25.5 ounce 2 Pack on S&S.

I was initially surprised by the bitterness, but over time have appreciated it because it cuts down on the unctousness; works great with the acidity in vinegars for dressings or dipping bread.

It turned out to be a huge disappointment because all I could taste was the milk I put in the coffee.<br /><br />When you read reviews of the Keurig coffee makers, people recommend using bolder, darker roasts. The Van Houtte French Vanilla is a light roast so I obviously knew it wasn't going to be strong. But to be devoid of any flavor is not acceptable. When I made the coffee this morning, I even paused the Keurig during the brew cycle to wet the grounds better in order to produce a more flavorful cup. I also used the 8 oz setting rather than the 10 oz setting on my machine. None of this had any effect. The coffee pouring into my cup was a nice, rich color but there was no coffee or vanilla aroma emanating from it.<br /><br />In this case, I honestly don't understand the positive reviews on this product.

But she injured a tooth once cracking through a beef knuckle bone, and I have since stopped providing her with hard bones. My dog has no interest at all in toys, unless there is a treat in it, then she pulls out the treat in 5 minutes and ignores the toy from then on. So I sought out rawhides as something to engage her off and on during the day. Though she'll chew eagerly on any rawhide I give her, I worry about her choking or gagging on a large hunk of it stuck in her throat, or a large piece getting stuck in her gut. This piggy twist, because it has such tight skinny strands, does not have that risk. On top of that,she'll take nearly two weeks of picking at it to finally finish it off, in spite of her persistance. I am so glad that she can have the rawhide she enjoys, that it doesn't get devoured in a day, and which allows me to feel safe giving it to her. I do wish I could get the 9 inch in a 3-5 pack.\n",

I got a rubbermaid container that has a handle and pours and it holds the whole thing.  I grind the beans every night when I set up my machine and it is very fresh.  We like strong, but not bitter coffee and we drink it black no sugar.  This is rich full bodied but never bitter or acidic tasting.  I have been using it for over a year and I will continue to use it until they no longer sell it.  My in-laws like it so much I am planning to get them a subscription for Christmas.  We used to use Gevalia, but this is far superior and less than half the price. When I first ordered it I was afraid we would not like it because it was so cheap.  It is the cheapest stuff I have ever bought.  I only bought it because a reviewer that was reviewing a different coffee I planned to get recommended this instead.\n",

My dog and I are loving this food so far. TMI but seriously, her poos are so small and barely smell. She liked it dry, which is kind of funny, but I do wet it sometimes. The feeding guidelines are a little ambiguous, so I plan to call Addiction directly. As for the store (Whole Health Pet, I believe), they are great! As I mentioned the wait was long, but I ordered from them twice and both times received a couple of samples and goodies for my dog; a sample packet of another grain-free Addiction flavor and a freeze dried meat treat - great attention to detail!\n",

      "Review: My dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food.  After trying MANY varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store, the Alpo Chicken in Gravy is all he will eat (I can sometimes feed him the T-Bone steak flavor).  I guess it looks and tastes more like \"people food\" than the other varieties.  My only complaint is that when I received the shipment (pack of 24), almost all of the cans were dented, and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can.  One can leaked out - the dent was at the seal on the top.  Normally, I'm not someone who is picky about dented cans, but this was a little much.  A couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when I opened them.  So, I guess I'll go back to buying at the grocery store.  Just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store.  Oh well.....\n",

I first was introduced to the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte at my hair stylist's. I have a Keurig and never realized this was a tea and that Keurig also carried them until I was on its website. I find they are often out of stock. I found these a bit cheaper here at Amazon and stocked up. Now when I get my hair done once/month and on the morning before I infuse, this is my little indulgence. The flavors and aroma are so calming and relaxing. I even insisted that my sister-in-law who gifted us with a Keurig coffee maker two years ago, try this. I know she likes certain teas and her coffee black. She could not believe it was tea. I sent her home with a box. The only reason I don't drink it more often is due to the empty calories/sugar. I probably should take a star off for that. I am one who does not like a really strong tea or bold coffee so this really pleases my palate. The Cafe Escapes Chai Latte is hands down my favorite.\n",

      "Review: I recently bought a Keurig coffee maker, but have always been a fan of chai tea. I am used to drinking Panera Bread's version, which is very good. However, chai tea is a spiced milk-based tea to me and most Americans. My Keurig adds water to its drinks so I was ready to be disappointed with this chai tea.<br /><br />As it brews and after taking a smell from the cup, you are hit with warm spices pretty hard. Cinnamon and ginger are ones that I made out but I knew right away it was going to be good.<br /><br />Taking a sip, it is obvious that this isn't a normal K-cup. Further analysis of the nutritional facts reveals that Cafe Escapes uses a creamer based formula and the result is a silky smooth chai tea latte. This is easily my favorite flavor for my Keurig coffee maker. I drink this one later in the day and it just makes you feel great. One of the best chai teas I have ever tried and WAY better than trying to brew it yourself and WAY cheaper than buying it from a cafe.<br /><br />If you don't know about Cafe Escapes and are maybe unsure of their quality, give this a shot, you will thank me (and them). They are known to use a milk-based formula in their K-cups and only make 4 flavors (Chai Tea, 2 different Hot chocolates, and a cafe mocha). I have personally tried all of their flavors and all are very good. However, the chai tea is the only one that I was absolutely blown away by. Two important notes about their brews is 1) their caffeine content is low at less than 10mg per cup (normal cup of coffee is around 100mg) and 2) they don't require you to add creamer or sugar as I am used to with other coffees.<br /><br />I felt that this review was best suited for the 96 count because if you have ever enjoyed chai tea and own a keurig coffee maker, you will be purchasing the 96-count of these at some point!\n",

The capsules are about 60% the size of the standard Nespresso capsules, so unless you like your coffee very weak, these Ne-Caps are not for you.  Even using as a single shot, the coffee tastes watered down.<br />2.  The version of of foil seals in my box are self-adhesive; much less fooling around than the peel-off rings contained in other kits.  Still this foil is much thinner than that found on standard Nespresso capsules, and may contribute to the excessive grinds that show up in the brewed product.<br />3.  I want fiber in my diet, but not fiber in my coffee; there are ALWAYS residual coffee grinds in the cup.  The brewed coffee often looks murky; there is always a ring of tiny coffee grinds.<br />4.  There are no instructions in the box, but the tiny rings SEEM to belong on the underside of the capsule, as without them the capsules tend to fall right through the slot on the Nespresso machine.  Why bother with the rings?  Why not make the the capsule tops a bit thicker in the first place?<br /><br />So until they make a bigger capsule, and solve the \"dirty coffee\" problem, this is a Two Star product.\n",

      "Review: I tried these on my Pixie machine, and since the capsules are not really made for it but older machines, they don't work well for newer models. The retrofit ring the capsules come with are a cheap band aid. I tried around 20 capsules before giving up. Most of the time there was excessive water flowing into the reservoir due to said incompatibility with the newer machines like my Pixie. I cannot speak for the older models.<br />There is also an environmental issue:<br />Once used, the ne caps are done and go into the garbage -  cutting the lid and using the grind for mulch is a good idea. However reusing them seems pointless and it is harder to separate the plastic from the aluminum left over lid than with the Nespresso type which is all aluminum.<br /><br />The better and much cheaper option: REUSE THE ORIGINAL NESPRESSO CAPSULES<br />I cut open and empty the regular Nespresso capsules to use the grind for mulch, then after washing and drying refill them at least once for another round with my favorite Espresso, crema type. The lid is a simple aluminum foil cut from standard foil roll (you can make multiple lids at the same time by layering foil pieces then cutting the circular lids with a scissor all at once. Make sure the circle is not too big, it should not extend too far up the capsule cone but stay neatly wrapped around the lip. Otherwise it can be leaky). Here a good link<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This means every so often you have to buy new capsules, but refilling them probably cuts the cost per capsule by 50% min. if used 2-3 times.\n",

These capsule are not perfect, but provide a good alternative.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- you can grind the coffee you like (I have used, so far, Illy beans and beans from the KC Roasterie)<br />- coffe has a density and creaminess typical of Italian baristas, you can actually taste the layers of the beans and the (small) crema blends well with the coffee<br />- you can save some money, or get better quality beans for the same price as Nespresso<br /><br />CONS:<br />- it takes a while to practice with these capsules (at least 20)<br />- coffe has still some variability (occasionally it comes out watery, but when it is well done it is way better than Nespresso)<br />- it's a bit messy (so not good for your office machine)<br />- foil does not always seal perfectly<br /><br />With time, I realized that the following steps improve a lot the quality of the espresso you get:<br />1. poor small amounts in your capsule and press heavily each time (secret for a good and rich espresso is how the water goes through the coffee)<br />2. seal tight eliminating as much air as possible<br />3. MAKE A RISTRETTO. If you drink long Nespressos, this is not for you, as the coffee will not be strong enough. The amount of coffee in the cup should be about 1/3 of a small cup with illy logo (yes, very little, that's why it is called espresso).<br /><br />I will buy these products again and try with other beans.

It is way too strong/fragrant. So much so that it barely smells like Tulsi (which has a very mild, consistent smell).<br /><br />What I'd like to stress to you at this point is that \"way too strong\" may exactly be what you love; but I didn't.

It's nice and spicy (you really get the flavor of black pepper) and actually easy to prepare.  Initially, I thought it was too complicated to boil water and then add milk separately, but it allows you to adjust to your own tastes.  I usually add a little more milk than instructed to cut down on the spice and add a little more creaminess.  The thing I really like about this chai mix is that it's not sweet at all.  If you want sweet, you add your own sweetener - I usually use a spoonful of white sugar or honey.  After drinking this stuff, I tried some pre-sweetended mix, and there was no comparison.

      "Review: Starbucks Sumatra has always been my favorite, so I was excited when the K-cup finally came out. Overall, they did a very good job. But one big caveat: If you get a Tall or Grande at Starbucks, one K-cup is not going to a good substitute. The largest setting on a Keurig platinum is 12oz, which is a Tall in Starbucks lingo. I've enjoyed this at 8oz, but too much of a sacrifice at larger settings. What this means is I typically need 2 K-cups for my morning fix. This can be an issue for any of the bold coffees, but since I've been a Starbucks Sumatra drinker for years, I notice it more---in taste and in my wallet.

But nothing beats a mix that can be dumped into a pot with some browned beef, or any other optional ingredient you favor, and have it be ready and delicious in 20 minutes or less.  Mrs. Grass is a very good mix compared to a lot of the ones more easily available in the stores.  It taste a little more like home made to me.  And believe me I haves tried all of them available in the stores.  The only reason I refer to it as second best if because I also buy the Bear Creek veggie beef soup mix also available on Amazon, (link enclosed).  I have to give the nod here to Bear Creek for just being a little spicier, and in my opinion having just a tad better beef broth.  I still highly recommend Mrs. Grass for it is much better than the store bought mixes, and besides, you may like your soup a little on the lighter side.  Still very tasty, and very worth it...

      "Review: I spotted this Mae Ploy sweet Chili Sauce (12-ounce bottle) in the international section of a local grocery store. It's imported from Thailand. I use regular chili sauce in a variety of ways and I love to try variants such as this. Into the shopping cart it went. Well, my, oh my, this stuf is excellent. It's both sweet and somewhat hot and has a nice variety of spicy flavors dominated by pickled red chili. So far, I've used it on eggs and small frozen dinners. Excellent. I can hardly wait to try it out on meats. This is, indeed, a very interesting variation from my ordinary chili sauce!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",

I love the Millstone Fog Lifter coffee so I was interested but read the review and found that they were made differently.  I hesitated but decided to try the 36 ct box.  I figured if I didn't like them somebody else might.  Was still skeptical and thought it might not work in my Keurig.<br />Works perfectly!  The Fog Chaser is delicious.  I like bold coffee and this is good strong but not bitter coffee.  I highly recommend it and others love it too.  We have a Keurig at work and I took one of the bags and shared.  Everybody loved it.

I've always had some un-addressed concerns about the composition of the plastic that other k-cups are made of, and what may be leaching into my beverage from the hot water passing over the coffee.  Look for these at costco where a 80 pack is 25$ (look around, not all stores carry them), but even on amazon it's a good deal with shipping included.\n",

      "Review: We've been buying San Francisco Bay Coffee French Roast in whole bean packages at a warehouse store for years, mostly because it was less expensive than the better known brands. To our surprise, we like its bold flavor better than the other brands. I always thought higher prices meant better tasting coffee. Not true! When we bought a Keurig coffee machine last January, I was resigned to trading a taste I prefer and an outstanding value, for the single cup convenience of the K-cups, which meant buying the more expensive brands of coffee in K-cups. Fortunately, the SFB Coffee people have made a single serving cup which fits in Keurig machines. It has the same flat, round top as K-cups, but the cup portion is a mesh filter cup, not made of plastic as with a K-cup. The SFBC cups work just as well in your Keurig machine and with less waste. I take a 16-oz. travel mug to work each morning, and I find the flavor to be consistent whether I make 8 ounces or 16 ounces. My sister-in-law's husband calls himself a coffee snob. He tried the SFBC French Roast for the first time today and was blown away by its rich flavor. He's now a believer and has ordered his first case.\n",

Aside from Dark Magic and Mahogany, this is better than almost every k-cup I have tasted.<br /><br />I may be in the minority here, but I actually prefer the filter-like bottom of these pods over the k-cup for four reasons:<br /><br />1. I've noticed no difference in freshness compared to the Nitrogen-filled, sealed k-cup.<br /><br />2. I don't have to waste filtered water and keep a paper clip handy to unclog the coffee grounds that get stuck in the needle of the Keurig because of pressure and temperature differences between where the k-cup was sealed and where it gets punctured.<br /><br />3. When brewing with these One Cups, the kitchen smells of freshly brewed coffee, an aroma I had missed when using k-cups.<br /><br />4. (And I realize not everyone will feel this way) - warning, nothing but complaining ahead:<br /><br />I had begun resenting being beholden to Keurig. I dutifully sent them money each month for k-cups and each month they found new ways to make me regret it. (Not shipping the k-cups out at all, allowing my package to sit in their warehouse for a week while they assured me it was on its way, consistently being out of stock of the k-cups I wanted and most of all, whenever I called or wrote to point out a problem, issuing a coupon code for free k-cups but then repeating the problem the following month.

      "Review: Like many Keurig users, I have been frustrated by the lack of choices in K-cup vendors. That is, while there are many types of coffees available, only Green Mountain can make the K-cup because of their patent.  Pricing has been held fairly high and steady. It would be nice to have a choice and better pricing.<br /><br />The SF Bay coffee appears to be a good alternative. I have used it for 2 weeks and it seems to be compatible with the Keurig machine. The coffee taste is good. I prefer a stronger taste and am ok with it a bit more bitter. As a frame of reference, I find the average 7 oz cup too weak and use the 3 or 5oz setting.<br /><br />As others have noted, the coffee comes in small bags of 8 \"pods\" each. You have to put the open bag in a ziploc bag for storage because the coffee in the pods is exposed in the filter.<br /><br />I really like the price of the SF Bay coffee.

Here's my take on the French Roast after drinking all 36 cups:<br />* I prefer this to the Fog Chaser, but I like a darker roast.<br />* Don't be scared by the look, it's just a K-Cup without the plastic case. I love that this seems more eco-friendly.<br />* Okay, it's true, they smell a little funny. Not quite sure why they don't just smell like coffee, but who knows what other K-cups smell like without the plastic cover, right? Our solution was just not to smell them before brewing.<br />* The taste is bold, and my first cup tasted bitter and not so great. We don't use sugar or sweeteners so there was nothing to mask the taste! But, like most new things, after a couple of cups over a couple of mornings I found the taste was fine, especially for the price. I don't know if I would serve this to company though, I like really dark roasts but most people don't.<br />* I read a tip that said to prevent grounds in your cup, close the brewer lid slowly and gently. Works for us, we've had NO grounds in our cups.<br />So there we go, I'm ordering them again to take advantage of the Subscribe & Save option. I'm not going to say that this is the best coffee I've ever had, but for that 1st cup in the morning it's just fine.\n",

I was in my local membership-required-big-box store (am I allowed to say Costco?) when I saw this stuff for about 27 cents per serving.  Since it's very easy to return stuff there, I bought it.  As others have commented, it's unusual looking, in that just the familiar looking K-Cup ring and foil at the top are there.  The plastic cup around the bottom is missing.  But that doesn't matter and it actually creates less waste and probably costs less to manufacture.<br /><br />Off course, being green doesn't matter if the coffee tastes bad.  In this case, it does not.  It's got to be one of the two best French Roast K-Cups I have ever had.  Full of flavor, without being bitter or burnt.

I suspect most folks are checking these reviews to find out if these weird cups actually work in a Keurig machine.  They do.  I had no issues.  The unexpected benefit was the great coffee aroma.  I love the Keurig system, but I miss the smell of coffee before it is prepared.  The aroma is back with these as soon as you open the plastic bag that they come in.  As much as I enjoyed the aroma, I felt compelled to store these things in another air-tight container, lest they lose their freshness. I also decided that I could not keep these cups in the rotary K-cup holder that we keep next to our machine.<br /><br />Despite storage issues, I would get these again for their flavor, aroma, and price.\n",

      "Review: Function: these cupless k-cups work perfectly in our Keurig B130 (the business version of the small personal brewer) which makes only a small cup.<br /><br />Less waste: We were really disappointed when we discovered that the plastic k-cups aren't recyclable. These are a terrific low-guilt, more responsible alternative.<br /><br />Less storage space: they take up much less room to store. I buy k-cups in quantity to save money, but then I had to dedicate a large cabinet to storing them! Not so with these, partially because they're less bulky and partially because...<br /><br />Great Price: these k-cups are much less expensive than other brands, especially at the Subscribe & Save price. At this price, I can buy less at a time and still pay less per cup than I could finagle with coupons & sales & bargain-shopping the major brands.<br /><br />Taste: Amazing!  I love a good dark French roast, and these are the best I've ever had.  Dark & rich but not bitter.  In fact, this morning I forgot to pour the creamer before I took a sip and I was amazed that it tasted really great.  I've tried to go without creamer before - I'd like to get used to coffee without it - but could never stand to...until I did it by mistake this morning and it was so smooth I drank the whole cup that way.  Trust me, this speaks volumes.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm keeping my subscription, and I just increased the frequency of my deliveries because we found we drink these more than the regular k-cups. How can you beat cheap, tasty, less bulky, and less waste?\n",

      "Review: This coffee is very good, it has a nice aroma and a good strong flavor.<br /><br />I also like the \"minimalist\" k-cup design, but have a couple complaints with it.  Since the individual pods aren't sealed, you have to keep them in a sealed package to prevent spoilage.  It would have been nice if the plastic bag they came in was re-sealable.<br />Also, since the coffee doesn't just come out of a small hole in the bottom of the pod, the first cup you make with these will wash all the stray grounds out of your machine and into your cup.  Be forewarned that you should wash the pod holder before using these.<br /><br />Overall I like the product, just be careful about the different pod shape.\n",

The bottles are opaque instead of the clear plastic I have seen in the past and is pictured. Secondly I thought the taste wasn't as strong as I had remembered but I didn't have any other mustard to compare it to. The more I used it the more convinced I became that it was not truly Grey Poupon since it just tasted like cheap dijon mustard to me. At Christmas I received a jar of real Grey Poupon and compared the two, no question they are not the same. I cannot return this item and I have used a few bottles.

It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.\n",

I feel good about giving them these as snacks or for training, for a few reasons.<br /><br />First, just like the box says they're \"guilt-free\"; made with brown rice and beef, they're wheat & gluten free, low fat and only 12 calories per treat -- so I feel good about not giving them \"junk food\", per se.<br /><br />Second, they're light & crispy -- like a puffed rice, so the pups aren't being weighed down by a heavy dog biscuit full of corn & sugar.  Lastly, the dogs REALLY like/crave these, so they've been a great tool for training, when I use the crisps as a positive reinforcement for good behavior.  When I'm doing repetitive action training over & over again (like teaching my one dog how to shake), I'd rather give him 10 of these than 10 pieces of hot dog or chemical-laden mushy dog snacks.  These brown rice & beef Barksters accomplish both of our needs and I'm actually rewarding him with something good for his body and his spirit.\n",

      "Review: Coffee preference is just a matter of taste, so my opinion regarding taste probably doesn't mean much. You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag.<br />I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices. This is probably why Keurig recently came out with a new brewer, \"the VUE\"  that uses different and patented cups.\n",

      "Review: I was given a Keurig as a gift and it is so easy to use that I use it almost exclusively.  I had previously used several favorite brands/types of coffee and I ground them fresh for use with a drip pot.<br /><br />Keurig K-cups do not normally meet my expectations, particularly in the strength of the brew but I have adopted the habit of using K-cups for my morning cup to \"chase the fog away\" and the brands I selected for daily use were good but expensive.  This coffee I found as part of a continuous effort to try new brands, to reduce waste but particularly in light of the increase of the price of my favorite brand to ~$0.71/K-cup.  Since I drink a double 7oz brew for that first cup to get enough volume with the brew size reduced for strength, that works out to nearly $1.50 a cup IN MY OWN KITCHEN for a less than premium brew.  This San Francisco Bay Coffee is of more than acceptable flavor and is very nicely priced @ $0.38/K-cup with an automatic repeating order-- close to half the price of my former choice.<br /><br />Incidentally, after the morning dose, if I want more, I then have enough functioning brain cells to recycle used, washed K-cups using the K-saver stainless steel lids <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XRTDVS\">Re-use K-Cups K-Savers Stainless Steel Lid 5 Pack, for Use with Keurig Machine</a> and my favorite Vietnamese coffee which costs ~$0.20/K-cup.  This is the best brew and the least wasteful way but I don't have the patience too do it in the early morning until awake.  I recommend it highly.<br /><br />San Fran Bay coffee are very similar to K-cups but they do not have a complete cup attached to the mesh brew bag.  This eliminates a lot of hard plastic waste.\n",

I tried it because it is a little cheaper, but still convenient, with the rising cost of coffee (and everything else) compared to grinding yourself and using the ekcobrew (which works much better than the standard k-cup self grind accessory, but is still a bit of a hassle with clean up).  We do vacuum seal a canister with these once we open the plastic bag (the order came with 3 bags of 12 pods), to keep the coffee fresh (since they can't have the oxygen purged like a normal k-cup for freshness).  Overall a nice strong cup that is smooth, with less hassle than self grind and fairly cheap (even cheaper with subscribe and save)\n",

      "Review: Overall its just OK when considering the price of other K-cups.  The SF Coffee K-cups do not look like other K-cups in that they do not have the plastic base which contains and seals around the coffee filter.  This exposes the coffee to air and faster oxidation.  When drinking the coffee it lacks a fresh flavor and tastes a bit stale.  The K-cups come in a sealed plastic bag, but once its opened, the k-cups are exposed to air and they quickly go stale.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is a bit weak as well.  The lack of the plastic housing around the coffee filter, in my opinion, causes the water to flow thru the coffee too quickly and contributes to a weak flavor.<br /><br />I don't think I would buy these again.\n",

      "Review: As many other reviews have mentioned, these are not the normal K-Cups, but they work much the same. I generally drink the stronger K-cups (Emeril's, Jet Fuel, Kona, etc), and I find that these Fog Chaser pods compare very favorably. There is no bitter aftertaste, just smooth flavor. I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years. We've just finished the first bag of 12 (6 days), which we kept in a ziplock bag, and the last cup tasted as good as the first. I already placed a subscribe and save order for the French Roast to try out. I will be keeping my subscription for the Fog Chaser, as it is quite good.\n",

Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod.  With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly.  There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job.  I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine.

I really like the fact that this comes packed in 10 individual packs of 8 k-cups each. The reason for this is that these k-cups are different in their construction. Each one is plastic at the top but filter for the lower 3/4 of the k-cup. At first I thought..oh no..I see a big mess coming, but to my great surprise, everything went perfectly.

      "Review: I will definitely buy the San Francisco Bay Coffee again.  After I try the other flavors, I will use the subsription plan.<br /><br />After meeting my husband, I started drinking darker roast coffees, and this Fog Chaser was bold and delicious.  But the biggest reason why I tried this brand was because of the lack of the extra plastic.  I've felt bad about the excess plastic that was being discarded with K-cups.  I've bought a wide variety of gadgets that are compatible with Keurig, all in attempts to reduce waste.  Some had a re-usable cup with small inner paper filter, (which I still use when I acquire my own ground coffee) others were caps that went over re-used K-cups after they were emptied and rinsed.  But that all takes time that I don't always have.  I feel better that these have less waste PLUS they're less expensive than regular K-cups.  A subscription will make it that much cheaper.<br /><br />The box has separate bags of 8 coffee pods each.  I don't think maintaining freshness is an issue for me, since once I open up a bag, I simply put them in a sealed plastic container.  There is one plastic container included in the box, but it's a little on the flimsy side, certainly not Tupperware tough, but it's still enough to store these.  I drink one to two cups a day, so the opened bag doesn't have a chance to sit around long anyways.<br /><br />This fit perfectly in my Keurig machine, too.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this to others.\n",

Having bought this blend before I knew what to expect, and it didn't let me down. It delivers a full-bodied cup of coffee, with a fantastic nutty, sweet kinda spicy-chocolaty finish. On the technical side, I like that they've figured out a way to work around using all the plastic. These \"K-Cups\" are an ingenious design using a filter instead. Absolutely a splendid cup of coffee all around. This product has been added to my Subscription orders with Amazon.\n",

I used to buy the very expensive dark roast K-cups but i saw these on sale and decided to try them based on the good reviews. First, the cup itself is awesome.  Far less plastic than 'regular' K-cups, so there's less waste. The flavor is awesome-- dark brew but no bitterness or sourness.  Nice bite, clean aftertaste.  This, in my opinion, tastes more like my local coffee house brew than any other K-cup on the market.  and Amazon has great prices on these, especially with subscribe & save.\n",

      "Review: I rarely rate things 5 stars, this coffee deserves the top rating. It is incredibly good, I don't think I want a cup of coffee and then I remember these are in the carousel for my Keurig machine, I change my mind in a heartbeat. It's like having a box of your favorite snack in the cupboard and trying to resist eating it, but you know it's there and you keep thinking about it.<br /><br />The flavor of this San Fransisco Bay coffee is rich, complex, and delicious. I can't think of a cup of coffee that I've bought anywhere that can beat the bold, rich flavor of this brand. It's like drinking a glass of fine wine. My favorite k-cup previous to this was Tulley's Kona Blend.<br /><br />The packaging of the individual coffee pod threw me off because when I opened the plastic bag with the pods in it, a very strong aroma of coffee filled the air. I wondered if the paper filter bottoms of the pods wouldn't let the coffee get stale, so I put them in a ziplock baggie. Time will tell I guess if the paper filter will allow the coffee to get stale or not. On the other hand I liked that there was a more green solution to the regular plastic coffee pod holder. I'm torn on this, I 'think' I'd rather have the pods be the more usual plastic in order to preserve freshness, but time will tell. I doubt any of the pods I have will have time to ever get stale however, because I'm drinking them all the time.\n",

      "Review: I just poured my first cup of San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-cup Brewers, and it is great! First of all, the Fog Chaser Coffee will do it's job to chase the Fog away: It is REALLY BOLD! I brewed a medium cup because I like bold coffee and was not sure if this brand would deliver. Next time I will not be afraid to brew a large cup. The coffee is rich, flavorful, and did I say Bold?<br /><br />Secondly, I love my Keurig, but hated feeling guilty about all the plastic I was adding to the landfills using the Keurig K-Cups. This pod uses at least 1/3 of the plastic of the standard K-Cup: There is a plastic ring holding the mesh coffee filter pod to the foil cap. Environmentally, this is a step in the right direction. I also feel the design of the pod is what allows the coffee to brew stronger, smoother and with more flavor!<br /><br />My husband does not like his coffee as bold as I do, so I look forward to trying out the other flavors of San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup.\n",

I love a good strong cup of coffee and I love my Keurig brewer.  But I am a cheapskate at heart and hated paying the price for the regular K-cups. This is a great compromise.<br />Since it does not have the plastic cup base and is just a round filter hanging from the top ring, you have to keep them sealed in a zip-lock or similar air tight container or they will not stay fresh.  That is a small inconvenience I can live with.  They also reduce our use of plastic and the trash we generate and I suspect that there may be health benefits from not brewing the coffee in the little plastic cup.\n",

      "Review: Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style has been my favorite (prepackaged) coffee for my Keurig.  Fog Chaser may come in a close second.  I started on this one as the Kona hasn't been available for awhile now.  The Fog Chaser is a medium-bodied blend that does well any time of the day.  I like it iced also.  It's smooth with earth and cedar notes.  Not sweet, but not bitter.  A nice balance.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the plastic bags with the air seals on them.  No coffee, no matter if it's whole bean, refrigerated, or in fancy packaging will retain the same flavor profile it had in the first weeks after it's roasted.  Coffee should be drunk in about 2-3 days after it's roasted and for about another 2-4 weeks.  The majority of flavor in coffee comes from it's aromatics, and they are gone in a relatively short period of time.  When I have time I buy green coffee beans, roast them in my air pop popcorn poppers, wait 2-3 days, grind as needed, and drink it all in the next 2-4 weeks.

      "Review: After reading the reviews we jumped in with both feet and ordered this and the French Roast. Here's my take on the Fog Chaser after drinking all 36 cups:<br />* I prefer the French Roast, but I like a darker roast. This has a fruity undertone, similar to a Breakfast Blend, that I personally don't care for. But, my husband likes it and I find it drinkable.<br />* Don't be scared by the look, it's just a K-Cup without the plastic case. I love that this seems more eco-friendly.<br />* Okay, it's true, they smell a little funny. Not quite sure why they don't just smell like coffee, but who knows what other K-cups smell like without the plastic cover, right? Our solution was just not to smell them before brewing.<br />* The taste is pretty strong, and my first cup tasted bitter and not so great. We don't use sugar or sweeteners so there was nothing to mask the taste! But, like most new things, after a couple of cups over a couple of mornings I found the taste was fine, especially for the price. I don't know if I would serve this to company though, I like darker roasts but most people don't, and this is a little more bold than mild. There is a not-totally-pleasant aftertaste, but not enough to not drink it.<br />* I read a tip that said to prevent grounds in your cup, close the brewer lid slowly and gently. Works for us, we've had NO grounds in our cups.<br />So there we go, I'm ordering them again to take advantage of the Subscribe & Save option. I'm not going to say that this is the best coffee I've ever had, but for that 1st cup in the morning it's just fine.\n",

      "Review: I purchased this because another reviewer likened it to Coffee People's Jet Fuel.  Unfortunately it is not even close.<br />The first cup seemed fine. The flavor immediately after brewing is good, but as soon as it cools down some it turns harsh fast.<br />The open-filter is a poor design. It can and absolutely will go stale.  I compared the scent of the final coffee pouch(cup?) from a previously opened bag to a newly opened, and the scent is completely different. Think old coffee can vs. freshly opened.<br />The other gripe on the filter is the poor filtration. There is always sediment at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />About me: I am very picky about my coffee. I drink it straight black and brew at 8oz with double filtered water in a Cuisinart Keurig coffee maker.  I don't reuse k-cups!<br />My favorite coffees are Coffee People's Black Tiger and Jet Fuel, Caribou's Mahogany and Van Houtte's Eclipse.\n",

The cups are intersting in that they have a wider brim so they fit right into the Keurig without touching the bottom poker. I brewed a 12oz. cup and a 16oz. cup. The 16 was more to my liking, but the acidity of the coffee made it difficult to finish either cup. Just a little too strong for my liking. Interesting packaging.

I always felt kind of guilty putting so many plastic cups in the garbage. Now to the coffee it is absolutely the best I have had.  A 10oz cup is possible without tasting too watery, especially with the French roast.  Every one of the Rogers family cups are great.  The fog chaser is a little smoother than the french roast but nice and dark.  The french roast is great also not quite as bitter as the usual french roast even the decaf is great.  This coffee rivals fresh brewed easily and is less expensive which is a bonus for those of us who want the freedom of K cups but don't like the price.  I will buy this brand from now on, I am a loyal customer of this Old San Francisco Bay Coffee.  Rogers family thanks for bringing real coffee to Keurig.\n",

And sometimes it allows the coffee sediment to leak through. It doesn't happen all the time, found to be about 20-25% of the time. Also you have to place cups in a zip lock baggie to keep fresh, after you open Mfg's.bag. If it weren't for this I would have given it 5 Stars.\n",

      "Review: First of all, the coffee is quite rich, and definitely appropriately labeled Fog Chaser!  Non bitter, smooth bold medium-dark roast.  It is one of my personal favorites.  But the purchaser should be aware of how this coffee is packaged. It works great in the Keurig machines but the packaging is not a true K-cup.  A K-cup, as designed (and probably patented), is a small plastic cup sealed with a foil lid, under which is a coffee filter pouch of a single serving of coffee.  The packaging on this does not have the plastic cup encasing the foil lid and filter paper pouch of coffee.  I suspect the manufacturer is saving in paying licensing fees from using the K-Cup design by excluding the cup.  But you have to use different storage containers for these packages, as using the usual racks and other means of storing K-Cups will allow air to get to the coffee and cause it to go stale unless stored in an air-tight container or plastic bag.  Also, this packaging may not work in Keurig brewers that automatically dispose of the spent K-Cups.  Another slight inconvenience is that the brewed package leaves a wet coffee filter sack of coffee grounds, whereas with a genuine K-Cup, the spent package only has one small hole in the bottom of the plastic cup, the rest of the package is dry upon disposal handling.\n",

I have nearly finished my first order of the Fog Chaser and it is one of the better coffees I've had for the Keurig.  The k-cups are little different than the traditional plastic cups, but who cares?  And I can't figure out what \"smell\" other reviewers are talking about.  When you open a bag, it smells like ground COFFEE.  Uh, that is not a bad thing.  It is because the cups are made of a breathable filter pouch.  What does a box of regular K-cups smell like?  Plastic cups?<br />Each twelve comes in its own sealed plastic bag so I am not worried about them going stale unless it takes you a couple months to drink 12 cups.  And the price is much lower than most of the of the other brands.  I can't see spending 1 1/2 to 2 times as much for coffee that is either not as good or at best just as good.

      "Review: I wish I didn't feel like I have to give this product a low rating, but I wouldn't buy it again without some changes.  It's really delicious coffee -- bold and flavorful, without the mouth-puckering acidity of some of the coffee I've tried.  The flavor changes as it cools, too.  Most delightful.<br /><br />However.  The first time I used one it really made a mess.  I had to clean coffee grounds out of the brewing doohickey on the Keurig (which I hate doing because it's tedious), and there was quite a bit of sediment in my cup, too.  It's exactly the same thing that happens with my reusable k-cup.  I was trying to find an alternative to that, and to contributing so many of those little plastic planet-polluter K-cups to the landfill.  (We drink a lot of coffee.)<br /><br />If the company could find a way to keep that from happening -- a coarser grind, maybe? -- I'd for sure try this again.  I can use the remaining pods, though. They'll be handy for traveling with. I tried opening one and brewing the coffee in my Aeropress and they're just right for that.<br /><br />And then, later on...<br />I had to come back and update this review.  We ran out of Kcups, and I dug these out of the cupboard in desperation.  My husband likes them so much that I'm ordering more, messy or not.  BTW, he said he considers the sediment minimal, and not much of an issue at all.\n",

We all know (and love) the ease of popping in a cup, pressing the brew button, and tossing the cup afterwards.  So easy!  However I've always felt guilty about the waste, as normally I compost coffee grounds and of course there is no plastic associated with a paper coffee filter.  You can buy refillable K-cups but none of them fit my B30 apparently and anyway the convenience factor diminishes greatly.  These work in my B30 perfectly.

I buy my k-cups in quantity to save money, but then I had to dedicate a large cabinet to storing them!  Not so with these, partially because they're less bulky and partially because...<br /><br />Great Price: these k-cups are much less expensive than other brands, especially at the Subscribe & Save price.  At this price, I can buy less at a time and still pay way less per cup than I could finagle with coupons & sales & bargain-shopping the major brands.<br /><br />Taste: Ok, obviously this is the most important factor...and so as soon as they arrived I threw one in and...hurray, they're tasty!  Fog Chaser is a slightly less strong taste than I usually drink, but I find it pleasant & smooth & complex in flavor.

      "Review: I really liked this coffee, but it will not be on my list of coffees to buy again because of the one major flaw.  It comes in a sealed bag and when you open it, the aroma is tantalizing.  Too bad it is so short lived.  Unless you are going to drink 12 cups of coffee, or have a bigger family who will in one day, that is the last fresh cup you will get.  There is no bottom to this K-cup except what would be around a pod of coffee so the air destroys it quickly.  After I took out the few we would need for breakfast, I sealed the unused \"k-cups\" in a plastic bag, but for the next couple mornings when I got some out, the aroma had faded more and more.  I love the way the original K-cups stay fresh until you use them, and these are not like that.  I also didn't like how I couldn't put them in my carousel of other K-cups.  Kind of a pain to have them sealed in the cupboard until I wanted them.  Don't get me wrong, the coffee was excellent when we first opened the package, but the quality diminished quickly.  If you are one of those people who drinks the same kind of coffee every morning and have several people drinking it, this may work for you.  I like to have variety in the morning whether it be Jet Fuel or Italian roast according to how I feel that day so these won't be purchased by me again.\n",

Opening and closing a zip lock isn't going to cut it, as air gets in each time.<br />Also, without the cup, I don't think the coffee gets a chance to 'seep' long enough, as it seems a bit weak for something called Fog Cutter.<br />Think I'll avoid this one in the future.\n",

They also make a french roast which I thought was OK. But again, a bit weak for a french roast coffee.

      "Review: I love my Keurig, but the cost of the cups had me looking for a better deal, and I was getting tired of adding to the plastic in the world with every cup of coffee.  I tried peeling the tops and bought the new lids to iron on (too messy and time consuming) and I do have the refillable cups you can use repeatedly, but those are messy, too.  I always thought the goal of a Keurig was a quick single cup of good coffee without the mess or fuss of a regular coffee maker. During a recent browsing day on Amazon, I ordered this product.  Surprisingly, the missing bottom to the cup is not an issue!  Spouse and I love the coffee, it is rich (read strong) enough for him, and tasty for me (I add a little hot water to mine.)  If you want to recycle the grounds, they are much easier to get to since you only have to tear open the paper basket on the bottom.  The cups come in sealed bags of 10 cups at a time to preserve freshness, so buying 80 is no problem.  This purchase was cheaper than my local Costco, too.  I also bought the decaf, and it is great as well.  Definitely a recommend!\n",

I was skeptical at first because the pictures showed a lack of complete shell for the coffee, and I wasn't sure how the pressure brewing would work.  But I must say that this coffee has more aroma, strength and flavor than most Keurig brewed coffees.  It comes in small bags, containing 12 each.  I usually transfer them to a freezer bag right away once I open each bag.  This helps keep the flavor a little more.

I have tried dozens of different K-cups and all of them made a decent cup of coffee but when I really wanted something good I had to use the french press. These K-cups are by far the best. I love opening up a bag of them and smelling that sweet smell of coffee, something you just don't get with the plastic ones. The taste of these is bolder and stronger than even the most potent plastic version. Lastly these will biodegrade a lot quicker than the plastic ones making them better for the environment.<br /><br />One last quick tip: Put them in a ziplock to retain that fresh ground coffee smell and taste.\n",

It has a wonderful aroma and a bold but not harsh flavor that I really enjoy.

      "Review: Have the rest of you coffee lovers nearly fainted over the sharply rising price of coffee? When Amazon sent me an email with a link to this coffee it was cheap enough that I thought I would give it a try. I use and love Newman's Own Organic-Caribou Blend and Sumatran Reserve on a daily basis. The price on those k-cups right now is $65 to $.70 per k-cup. I am always looking for a good bold k-cup that is less expensive. These look different than a k-cup and they need to be in an airtight container after you open them. You need a small container as you only open 12 at a time-the rest stay vacuum sealed. I can't understand the fuss about the packaging-it is a simple thing to put them in a Tupperware type container. The bottom line for me is that the subscription price for this coffer is about $.41 per serving as opposed to $.70 per serving-and the coffee is GREAT! I love the coffee and I now drink it daily. I have not given up the expensive blends that I love-but this one works for me for my 3rd and 4th cup of the day. Just give it a try-some of you will not like it-but some of you will find it to be an excellent and reasonably priced supplement to those very expensive k-cups that we all love.\n",

      "Review: I made the mistake of buying 72 of these K-cups. The other reviews were good, so I thought I would like them. First of all, I enjoy strong coffee thats not bitter.  When I got these and opened up a pack, the odor was wierd, in a way thats kind of hard to describe, they smelled terrible, not like coffee at all. They are to be used in the Keurig machines but have a filter casing, not plastic like the regular K- cups, which is not a problem.  The coffee tasted terrible. The date was fresh, so it wasnt that the coffee was old. I will never again waste my money on this brand.  I cant understand why the company would put out a product like this and expect it to sell, I for one will never buy it again.  I drink alot of coffee, 4 cups at least daily, So far the best ones I have had are the Starbucks,Caribou,and Newmans Own (bold).I hope this helps with your future buying decision.

      "Review: While I am happy with the coffee itself, I find the description of this item as \"for Keurig K-Cup Brewers\" to be slightly misleading.<br /><br />As a recent reviewer points out that these OneCup pods are mesh pouches with a foil top. Twelve of these pods are contained in a sealed plastic bag. Once the bag is opened, the coffee does seem to be more \"exposed\" to air which raises the possibility that they then go stale faster than a sealed K-Cup.<br /><br />Comments on the previous review said that the coffee has noticeable degradation in quality after 14 days of opening the sealed plastic bag. This seems unacceptable to me because the point of a Keurig Brewer is choice - having to use all 12 OneCups within 14 days limits my ability to choose other coffees.<br /><br />All considered, the company is using this \"OneCup\" packaging to expand their market to other brewing systems and save the costs associated with multiple types of packaging (and possibly multiple licensing agreements?). They pass this savings on by pricing these cups a couple cents less per cup than K-Cups - the price can be further reduced a few cents with Subscribe and Save. Subscribe and Save was the initial reason why I chose these cups - being a convenient way to keep a steady supply of a \"house\" coffee for myself and guests. This convenience is reduced by the fact that the packaging is not ideal for maintaining freshness. As noted by other commenters, the solution may be to put the rest of the OneCups into a Ziplock bag and hope that this will maintain freshness until I use up the others - not exactly elegant.\n",

      "Review: Like many others, the price point of this coffee got my attention but what's the point of cheaper coffee that's all but undrinkable... Grove Square, anyone?<br /><br />So before ordering on price alone I wanted to see other reviewers contrast and compare this blend to other k-cups such as Timothy's Midnight Magic, Emeril's Extra Bold or Jet Fuel. After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor. But hey, this is French Roast and as such the taste seems well suited.<br />Nevertheless, no regrets...it's a nice bold brew (with an appealing price) that I look forward each morning.\n",

      "Review: I was a little worried about this k-cup since it is shaped differently from the regular k-cups. Instead of being in a fully plastic container, only the top is plastic. The bottom part is enclosed in a coffee filter type holding. While this means that when I opened the sealed wrapper I was hit with the delicious aroma of coffee, something I miss when I open a regular pack of k-cups, it also means I have to store the remaining cups in a tupperware or storage ziploc type bag to keep the remaining cups from going stale. This isn't a big deal, just something to mention. These also wouldn't fit in the normal k-cup carousel.<br /><br />I have a b60 and the cup fit perfectly, brewed up great, disposal was easy and the filter didn't tear or leak as I was throwing it way.<br /><br />Fog chaser is a bold deep brew (I brew on the middle button of my keurig) The coffee is very smooth and mellow with a terrific aroma.

      "Review: I've urged Amazon to change this product's listing so as not to trick anyone else into buying it, but until they do, I want to add my voice to the revelations hidden in a few reviews that are already here. Please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty, the second is unlikely to be as good, and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve-cup-a-day sort of household.<br /><br />Why? Simply put, these are not K-Cups. They are not individually sealed portions, but instead are open mesh coffee pods, not dissimilar to Senseo pods, topped with a K-Cup-like plastic ring and foil cover. That cover does make them work in Keurig brewers, but you lose the important freshness-preserving feature of K-Cups. The company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag, but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes -- just much, much harder to open. That's especially ironic given Amazon's recent move toward frustration-free packaging.<br /><br />I strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the San Francisco Bay Coffee folks can temper their (laudable) green-focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box.\n",

Since the price was right and we liked the coffee, we ordered again. The 2nd shipment we received was still \"good\" coffee, but it wasn't as great as the first. My husband says he couldn't tell much difference, but the 2nd shipment did not have the same smooth finish and mouth-watering aroma as the original. That being said, it did not stop us from drinking it all, but I do have to wonder which is the abnormality! I rated this at a 4 since we were so impressed by the first shipment, and I really like the way the OneCup brews. As other reviewers mentioned, there is a \"crema\" produced by the OneCup that you rarely see with a K-Cup, which is NICE! I like the less packaging, and don't mind the occasional sediment in my cup (when we brew coffee, we generally do French Press, so we can handle that!). If I had the option of rating 3.5 I would have, since the quality of the 2nd shipment would definitely rank a 3 most likely. I do think we will try this again and see if \"the third time is the charm\".

I own a Keurig one-cup brewer as well as a traditional coffee maker.<br />For years, I have been using the same coffee brand ( med or dark, middle-of-the road priced) and it was affordable and it tasted just fine. Lately, I was lacking depth and body when brewing in the keurig( I have the cup you can put your own coffee in, which saves resources and $). It seemed like I couldnt' pack enough flavor into the little chamber to really have the right strength. The pre-packed, ready to use K cups were much better, but at 3 cups/day for me not feasible in the long run.<br />I read the reviews of the San Francisco Bay coffee ( fog chaser) and the price appealed to me and also what customers had described, so I tried it. Besides the much more affordable price and far more \"green\" packaging, I find the flavor fantastic!<br />Bold, yet sophisticated, not just strong- really pleasant flavor ! A very good choice at an attractive price!. These cups look different, but I like them much better with their filter-like body and 12-count bagging. Now I don't feel guilty when I indulge with more than 1 K cup. For loose coffee to put into the reusable cup I choose a def. dark roast like italian or french, which is very comparable to the Fog chaser's aroma.\n",

(or you could use a plastic ziploc - original bag was not re-sealable).  They did one thing finally right - you don't have to pay MORE for going green when buying LESS packaging.  Kudos.\n",

We want her to get the nutrients and vitamins she needs (especially iron), so plain fruit or vegetables aren't enough.

Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  We particularly like that this food contains yogurt.  When she was young (~6 months old), our baby loved yogurt but couldn't eat it plain because it would cause a rash around her mouth.  She was never bothered by the yogurt in this food, though, perhaps because it was mixed with other things.  Now that she's older (10 months), our baby can eat all the yogurt she wants without a skin reaction, but for awhile, this variety of Wholesome Breakfast was the only source of her favorite food.\n",

Being a tea drinker I inquired about good english teas and they gave me a napkin with the names of bewleys tea on it and about 6 teabags for me to try. I put the napkin in my back pocket and the teabags got wrapped up in an old sandwich bag and put in my wife's purse. We parted with the nice english couple and as we traveled around disneyworld it began to rain that afternoon and we got soaking wet. I found what was left of the napkin that evening at the hotel and it was unreadable. About 6 months later at home the bag fell out of my tea closet as i was fixing to make a cup and I decided to finally try the tea those nice folks from england raved about.

      "Review: Recently purchased these treats for my 4 dogs from local grocery store. After giving my dogs these chews, my 3 month old puppy threw up the treat. By the next day at lunch time, he was exhibiting neurotoxic symptoms. We immediately took him to the vet for blood work, which all came back below normal limits. He was given IV therapy and monitored over night. Over the next two days, my older dogs (ages 4, 7 and 9)began vomiting and acting lethargic, but with no neurological symptoms. We traced the cause back to these chews, as it is the only coomon thing among all the dogs (puppy eats different food than adult dogs, puppy is walked on a leash not allowed to run around in yard yet, puppy is not out of his crate unless he is beig observed, etc.). After speaking with someone at a pet store, we learned some rawhide chews are pressed with water, while others are pressed with formaldehyde. While it is not listed which method these use, we are concerned it is the formaldehyde. In the case of the older dogs, their GIs are rejecting them due to the toxins. With the puppy, his immature renal and hepatic system exhibited neurotoxicity.\n",

This is the first tofu I've eaten in decades that I did not like.<br /><br />I bought this after reading that review and thinking the person was maybe not familiar with the taste of tofu, or perhaps tried to eat this without re-hydrating this first. No, it is like chewing on a sponge (Have we all by accident done this, or is it an early childhood memory of times when we tested everything with our mouths?) At any rate, you will instantly think \"sponge\" if you ignore these warnings and buy this tofu. I do not mean just the texture, it really tastes like a cellulose sponge!<br /><br />I am also a fan of Eden Foods and enjoy many of their products, they make great tamari, for instance. I was looking for that texture and taste I find in freeze dried tofu pieces that come in soup mixes as in instant miso tofu soup packets or soup cups. This isn't that tofu! It will not be wasted, it has good protein and I can chop it in very small pieces and mix it with Creamy Tomato Soup by Pacific Naturals, that makes it innocuous enough. But I'll never buy this again!<br /><br />I am looking into buying a food dehydrator to make my own. The cost of tofu is much lower that this item reflects. I will update this if I have success drying my own tofu. Believe the reviews here, this isn't good.\n",

It not only has to be rehydrated in a particular way, but also will not taste good without proper cooking to flavor and soften it. Even at that point, it will have a chewy, slightly spongey texture, but if cut and cooked appropriately, it is not a strange texture and is very delicious as a side dish.<br /><br />Google recipes for Koyadofu and try one that involves simmering it (after rehydration) in a broth made of katsuobushi (if you are not vegetarian -- if you are, then use mushroom or vegie stock), shouyu or tamari, mirin, and a little sweetner. My child loves this, and I pack it in her school lunch box along with rice, and some vegies that have been simmered in the same broth.\n",

Cheap beans, bad roast, whatever, my lot actually tastes like it is moldy. Maybe I just got a bad batch. I have tried the Buzzworthy dark roast Melitta Pods and they are drinkable, even though I prefer medium roast coffees. Suggest you try one box of these, not the 4 box lot I'm stuck with. Also, to help you evaluate this response better, you should know that I like quality roast Kenya AA or Sumatra or Columbian Supremo, etc. rich flavor type coffees. I don't like Folgers, Maxwell House, pedestrian type blends, but even those are way better than this coffee.\n",

      "Review: Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price. I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage. I would never buy anything from Aloha Island Coffee company again.\n",

      "Review: A friend of mine got me started drinking unsweetened green tea at Starbucks, and I fell in love with it.  It was delicious.  Because I enjoyed it so much, I ordered green tea when some coworkers took me to lunch at Kona in Baltimore Inner Harbor.  It was SO good, it blew the Starbucks stuff out of the water.  We eat at Kona a lot, and I always drink so much of the tea that I feel like I'm sloshing when I leave.  It's so rare that I find a drink that I enjoy sipping ... not just guzzling it down because I'm thirsty.<br /><br />Today, I finally asked the server which brand they serve, though I didn't have hopes of finding it in consumer size containers (I assumed they'd be buying from direct-to-restaurant suppliers).  I am SO thrilled to find that it's accessible.  And cheaply at that!  I'm about to order several of these to keep myself pleasantly stocked in the house.  this stuff is delightful.\n",

I pried open the bottle and took a sniff, wherein I noticed a slightly herbal scent; considering the long list of herbal ingredients on the label, this wasn't particularly suprising.  I then poured the nearly blood red elixir into a cup and took an initial swallow.  I was rather suprised by the initial bitterness of the soda; it definitely wasn't what I was expecting!  Continuing with a couple more swallows, I then started to notice a slight burning sensation in my esophagus -- this, no doubt, came from the jalape&ntilde;o oil that was infused into the beverage.  I wasn't sure if I liked this soda at first.  However, the more that I drank it, the more that I came to enjoy this bizarre concoction.  It also seemed to cure my morning craving for caffeine, so that was pretty cool too.  My co-workers weren't so thrilled with this beverage, but I thought that it was pretty good.

I had them 2 days after I ordered and I ordered on a Sunday.  However, once I opened them and ate a few I am disappointed.  The liquid center in these candies is gone and the cherries inside are all dried up.  Somehow the liquid filling either evaporated are just dried up as there is no sticky evidence of leaking in the box.  Also, the milk chocolate has a chalky look as if it has oxidized.  We can still eat them as they are okay, but they are not as advertized on the outside of the box as containing a clear liquid center.

      "Review: A diluted hot sauce derived from the jalape&ntilde;o pepper. A 5 oz bottle is far too small given its diluted nature. You might use close to a bottle for a single family sized meal.<br /><br />Ingredients (as listed, in this order, from the product label): Water, acetic acid, jalape&ntilde;o peppers, carrots, sugar, ...etc<br /><br />Tasting notes - diluted heat along with a heavy vinegar taste and, at best, a vague jalape&ntilde;o flavor.  The vinegar flavor dominates (acetic acid is a component of vinegar).<br /><br />As noted in the title of my review - a below average hot sauce. I'd pass on this one. The vinegar taste is over powering. Note that the second ingredient (after water) is acetic acid (a chemical component of vinegar)!<br /><br />I'd recommend the El Yucateco Hot Jalape&ntilde;o Hot sauce which uses the same Jalape&ntilde;o pepper but it has a much purer and fresher taste. I love the Jalape&ntilde;o pepper but this sauce does not feature its fine qualities very well.<br /><br />PS - As should be evident -- I enjoy taste testing hot sauces and writing up my results. I've tried about 50 different ones to date. I try very hard to describe flavor notes and list the actual ingredients.\n",

      "Review: I saw a bottle of this at my local grocer. I love jalapenos and seeing a red jalapeno sauce made it a must buy.<br /><br />The sauce was not what I expected, I was expecting a thin vinegary kind of Mexican hot sauce. This sauce is much thicker than that, but not as thick as ketchup. It is a bit tangy with a balance of sweet and heat. The label says \"Very Hot\", but it will only seem this way to those who are more sensitive to heat than the average spicy food fan.<br /><br />After my first taste the first thing that came to mind was hot wings. They have the perfect tangy/sweet/hot sort of flavor profile, along with a consistency that lends itself very well to sticking to wings (both cooked and raw). It is also thick enough to be brushed on wings while they are being cooked on a grill. I began to wonder if the brand name was called \"Bufalo\" because it was intended to be used for wings, but after some research I found out that the company name precedes Buffalo Wings by quite a long time, the name is pure coincidence.<br /><br />As a wing sauce this stuff is a welcome addition. It is a very slight change from your standard hot wing flavor, being made with Jalapenos, while still very true to the flavor you expect from hot wings. As a hot sauce on its own it is good but each time I try it on something else I keep coming back to how much this tastes like a wing sauce.<br /><br />I recommend giving this stuff a try to see what you think. Definitely try it on your next set of wings. My next bottle will be the larger sized bottle because I plan to make some more wings with this stuff.\n",

The down-side of this product is the gas \"problem\" when you eat excess (???) amounts of it. I use it in place of Karo syrup to make almond-crusted pecan pies. It produces an \"okay\" pie. However, I eat large slices of this pecan pie and that causes the gas \"problem\". I bought bottles of Nature's Hollow and Natrazyle Kosher substitutes for side-by-side comparison with Honey Tree. Although neither caused a gas \"problem\", I believe both are lacking in flavor and the Natrazyle appeared to have a slimy \"mouth-feel\". I will try each of these in a pecan pie and if I believe either of the pies is better than the Honey Tree pie, I will report back.\n",

      "Review: I noticed a difference between the quality of this matcha and a much more expensive variety.  I am currently a matcha neophyte but I noticed that the expensive matcha tasted significantly better, seemed more fresh, and had a better brighter color.  I use one heaping teaspoon per pint of hot water, and unfortunately with the more expensive variety it costs over five dollars per pint of matcha tea when you use this much.  Even so, if you can afford it, seek out the finer grades of matcha straight from Uji Japan.  The Uji region is famous for their fine Gyokuro tea and superior grades of matcha.  If you don't have that kind of money, this matcha could suffice, but try to get the Uji-based premium matchas, especially for special occasions.  This matcha is listed as being from Uji, but it isn't as good as the more expensive varieties from the same area.\n",

      "Review: A few years ago we received a gift of salt someone brought us from Hawaii.  A beautiful salt that was a pink/beige color, a great texture and size, and lovely taste that enhanced all food.  It came in a baggie...sigh.  I've been looking to replace it ever since so I thought I'd try this salt.  My honest reaction about this salt - I don't get it.  I like the course texture of the salt.  It's a bit more chunky then we like though you do feel it when you eat.  The taste?  Here it is, I don't get it.  There is a critical mass point putting this salt on your food - and what we feel is that it's nothing or simply too much.  I know, I'm giving a lot of words here.  It's just that there are all these great reviews of how amazing it is.  The salt is kind of tasteless on the finger.  On food it seems to need a lot and then ICK!!!!  So my recommendation is a 3 because maybe we simply haven't found the exact amount to use to create the taste everyone is raving about.  I keep trying and it's either no taste at all or so over powering the food is awful.  For the price I'm tossing it in the garbage because it's too much a pain at meal time when I'm trying to figure it out.  I can't say it's awful because maybe it's us.  We are salt lovers and we buy and understand salt.  This salt?  I don't get it.  And that is actually saying something.  So I guess I'll take a stand and say - we don't like it.  I've tried it on simple and complex food and recipes.  Too risky when time is so busy these days to have to find a balance of the amount you use.  Going back to Morton's course kosher salt or our sea salt bought locally in Maine until I find that salt that matches the gift from Hawaii...\n",

I decided to buy some for my home recently here. I find it is better used as a finisher, i.e.  sprinkled on foods. I also use it in seafood rubs quite often. My favorite uses are sprinkled on fresh veggies such as cucumber slices and heirloom tomatoes, on chocolate/caramel dishes, and used with seafood. I have several salts, so i generally use this for those three purposes, but sometimes, I'll add it to other dishes as well. It doesnt really dissolve quickly (probably due to the red clay which gives it its color), so it is better used in dishes where that isnt an expectation. Otherwise, it is multifunctional and i think you'll like it. Enjoy!\n",

It's extremely tasty on heirloom tomatoes. It looks appetizing on steaks and chops, sprinkled at the last moment before serving. It's something to reserve for \"finishing\" and \"plating\" food. A six-ounce jar will last a long time in most kitchens, so this is a decent value.<br /><br />If you live in the South, you might try sprinkling alaea sea salt on the tail of the next ivory-billed woodpecker or Carolina parroquet you see, as a means of clearing the land for development.\n",

      "Review: Yep, this is A LOT of curry powder, but if you use it often in cooking, it really is a better price than paying several dollars for a tiny bottle (even McCormick's own tiny bottle) that'll be gone in no time - or worse, make you feel like you have to ration it.  I like curry powder and for once in my life, I wanted to use it and not feel I must skimp.  I paid just under $11 and in about a month, I've used maybe 3/4 of an ounce (I saved an empty 1 oz bottle to keep a more manageable portion on the spice rack).  Like another reviewer said, it IS possible it tastes a bit different from the 1 oz version, but I couldn't say for certain, and moreover, I don't think it's bad - I'm using it, mainly on rice dishes.  To me, it's legions better than <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007B9JCFM\">Taste Specialty Foods Hot Curry Powder, 16-Ounce</a> but not as good as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MXTMZO\">Rajah Mild Madras Curry Powder 100g</a>.<br /><br />Google \"curry powder health benefits\" and you'll find plenty of results; it's best known for its benefits to digestion and for anti-inflammatory qualities, but also said to boost memory and protect against Alzheimer disease and cancer.<br /><br />Ingredients: Coriander, Fenugreek, Turmeric, Cumin, Black Pepper, Bay Leaves, Celery seed, Nutmeg, Cloves, Onion, Red Pepper, Ginger.<br /><br />The expiration, I'm pleased to note since there is so darn much of this(!), is April 2014.\n",

As I'm writing this, they're unavailable on amazon, but I'm diligently checking as I'll be ordering a lot when they start selling them.<br /><br />I use this as a light, high protein pre workout drink, and I love that it has caffeine as that really helps me push myself in my early morning workouts.  I've tried milk+whey, but it was too heavy for me and always seemed to sit on my stomach and make me feel sluggish as I was trying to lift.  I've also tried water+whey, but mannnn that tastes horrendous and I just have a hard time doing it.  And neither of those have caffeine, which I think really helps to energize me.  So far I've tried the grape and berry, and liked both.  I haven't tried any of the other flavors.<br /><br />This does taste a little tiny bit bitter at times, and definitely isn't as good tasting as a protein shake, but it's perfect otherwise.  And you're not really drinking it for the taste anyways, are you?  Grab one of these, lift a lot of heavy weight up and down as many times as you can, follow up with a post-workout shake, rest and repeat, and you'll get strong.  Highly recommended!\n",

Like the other reviews available mentioned, it is NOT spicy by any real standards. For anyone who's been to a curry house chain restaurant, and ordered \"hot\" and not extra/super hot, you'll realize the definition of hot is rapidly changing to fit the more moderate group of individuals. If I'm really trying to save money that week, I just have a can a day. Half a can with rice, for lunch, and half a can with rice for dinner. I prefer to have it with long grain rice since its generally a bit dryer and goes better with the liquidy nature of the chili. I eat it with cheetos flaming hot chips, not the healthiest diet by any means, but it is a VERY cheap meal, and tastes great with the combination of things. What I like most about the chili is its high fiber content, I'm not one for eating a lot of vegetables, so the fiber in this really helps.\n",

My son was not a premie but at 6lbs 2oz he wasn't breaking the scale either so the extra calories in this formula are perfect for him. Also for some reason he has no trouble going back and forth from breast milk to the Neosure formula, my daughter struggled quite a bit when I introduced formula in her diet, it wasn't the Neosure. Bottom line is I have been very happy, and so has my little boy.\n",

      "Review: LaCosta Gourmet's customer service is incredibly wonderful.  Tonight, I ordered only one pound of coffee that needed to be delivered in two days.  I tried to order it with upgraded shipping but, after I got Amazon's confirmation, it showed standard shipping and could take 8 days, given the intervening federal holiday and weekend.  Seeing that, I emailed La Costa Gourmet to see if the shipping could be upgraded to 2-day.  Within five minutes--I kid you not, 5 minutes!!!, Jeff at La Costa Gourmet called me, assuring that the order was due to go out first thing in the morning and is expected to arrive in two days, no need for an additional shipping fee.  I know that the order for one pound of coffee seems like a small matter but, it is for a family member heading overseas.  This small matter was very important to me and obviously very important to La Costa Gourmet.  They have earned my undying loyalty for customer service, great communication, & not ripping me off for an additional shipping fee.\n",

      "Review: These sardines really stand out as the best national brand.  I like them because they are always found in perfect condition in the can, with their silvery skins sparkling, and heads and tails neatly trimmed away.  The flavor is delicate, lightly smokey and not too salty.  Though oilier than sardines packed in other sauces, rest assured that these contain pure olive oil and the natural fats of the fishes, which make them a good source of heart-healthy omega-3.  Drained of oil, they are roughly 150 calories per can.  The ingredients are simple:  Sardines, olive oil, and salt.<br /><br />How to eat them?<br /><br />Well, they are excellent right out of the can!  Most of the time, I decant them for draining and make an open-faced sandwich. They are very good on toasted Fisherman's Warf type sourdough bread, lightly spread with mayo, sweet pickle relish, and a dash or two of Tobasco.  The result is a nice midnight snack which never upsets the stomach.<br /><br />Finally, given the long shelf life, these cans of tiny fish would make a good addition to an emergency food supply.  At any given time, I've got a dozen or so (one case) stashed away, and I rotate them along with my other necessities.\n",

      "Review: I finally received my order of  buffalo bills  hot shot Hot flavor 2.1 lbs. I bought this because of all the review. My first thought about the taste of this beef stick is that it tasted really sour and i tasted some spices but it was far from hot,it wasn't even hot at all. Its easy to chew probably because it tasted too mushy and soft. The reason why i gave it a 2 star instead of 1 star is because it's was going for a good price. Overall, I wouldn't buy this beef stick because it taste mushy and sour, I'm sure it's not expired because  it says feb 2013. I knew i should've gotten the peperoni flavor beef sticks. Also, from all the other people's review i was expecting a sample from them since i read a lot of people received samples. I was kinda disappointed. So i won't be buying the hot shots again and its not because i didn't receieve a sample. haha\n",

Now and then I get a yen for beef sticks too, and here we are...<br /><br />Good points-- I agree that these are much less greasy than Slim Jims. The consistency of the filler is also much better.<br />  They came very quickly.<br /><br />Not so good points-- One review described them as 'spicy'. To me, 'spicy' adds twang while you're chewing. 'Hot' hangs around in your mouth after you've swallowed. These are 'hot'. They're not blisteringly hot; I'd go for maybe 4 or 5 on a 10 scale, but I wanted 'spicy' not 'hot'.<br />  They mostly just taste like some, uh... unique kind of liquid smoke. They almost taste like meat, but not quite.<br /><br />They're ok. I don't hate 'em, but doubt I'll repeat this particular experiment.\n",

      "Review: I wanted to try these out because of the price and because it seemed to have solid reviews. I really like Slim Jims, and this looked similar and had good reviews.<br /><br />I didn't notice any mushiness that some people claimed. I thought it had a good snap to it, although you can definitely see where the casing is and the rest of the product, and sometimes it will just slide out a bit.<br /><br />I like the packaging. You can stick these into a big slider ziplock bag and it makes it far more convenient than any individually wrapped product, like Slim Jims are. I don't know how well it will keep that way, but I think it should be fine because, well, these products are pretty much designed to be kept like that. I don't know why some companies individually wrap theirs, maybe someone else can chime in on that.<br /><br />And now for the negative. Originally I tried to be more diplomatic with it, because I didn't want to dock stars for it not tasting like a Slim Jim. My brother absolutely hated the sticks and considers them disgusting. I held out that they weren't that bad, but after forcing myself to eat them the last few days I now give up.<br /><br />But worse is the ingredients. These things pack MSG. There is no nutritional label so we don't even know the percentage of it. But it is listed as an ingredient. Now it depends on you if that is a problem or not, for me personally I want to avoid MSG so this product doesn't work for me.<br /><br />I will likely throw away the rest of what I have. It is better to go for regular jerky, which can actually be healthy. These sticks are however a different product that you have to look at carefully, and for me the taste just isn't good enough to justify eating them.\n",

      "Review: I bought these on the strength of the reviews.  Inside the thin wrapper the texture was mushy, and I didn't like the taste at all.  It tastes mostly of beef heart, smoke and spices.  I found them inedible.  I had several of my friends try them since I didn't want to waste them if someone else could eat them.  The first two friends did not like them, but the third did, so they found a home.  The free sample of barbeque beef jerky was delicious, and I am going to order some of that.<br /><br />Addendum: Not long after I wrote the above review, I recieved a telephone call from the company.  He said that they stand behind all of their products, and even though I could not return the item since I had given them away, he would send me a replacement of any other jerky.  He sent me the barbeque jerky which I had sampled before. with two additional free samples of other flavors, which were also quite good.  I have never dealt with such a wonderful concern for their customers as I experienced with this company.  I think you can't go wrong buying from them.  He said if anyone doesnt like what they get, they will replace it.\n",

I wish I knew about Short Shots sooner because these things are a great replacement!  I originally bought the Mild flavor as a camping/hiking take along snack and it was well received by all of the adults, but none of the kids.  After our trip and running low, I bought the Pepperoni flavor which I found to be more peppery and much saltier than the Mild flavor.  While I prefer the Mild, my husband and older daughter prefer the Pepperoni.  Next flavor we will try is the hot.  The texture is drier and chewier than Slim Jims, but I think the quality is better also.  I realize some people have a problem with beef heart as ingredient, but muscle is muscle (and this is probably in Slim Jims too).\n",

      "Review: I've had several brands of beef sticks and am not a very picky eater, so was surprised that there was a pretty big discrepancy between how this product was reviewed here and how it tasted. To me it tasted more like beef heart than beef (and I have actually sampled beef heart before, so I know what it tastes like! Not something I would buy); the skin provided some resistance but then it was very mushy on the inside. Maybe my batch had a higher proportion of that than normal? I got the hot flavor, but that did not mask the weirdness of the taste.<br /><br />The reason for two stars instead of one: I brought it with us while we were camping, and we were a little short on food. The short sticks provided sustenance even if we all grumbled a little bit about the taste. They didn't cause any diarrhea or stomach problems.<br /><br />Unlike other people I did not receive any samples from Buffalo Bills and so have no input with regards to how their other stuff tastes.\n",

      "Review: I've been ordering these for the past year or so. They make amazing snacks for camping trips and they're fun to share with people (until they come back asking for 2nds... and 3rds...). Yeah, they're that good. As some others have said, imagine a Slim Jim, but without all of the grease that soaks out everywhere. It's true that it doesn't have that 'authentic' pepperoni taste, but in my opinion it's more than good enough. Not only that, but the people at Choo Choo snacks are generous enough to add in a sampler for some of their other products in every order. Their jerky samples taste incredible, but I'm more of a beef stick person. I like the snap that they make when you bite into them. Buffalo Bills short shots are more than worth the asking price. If you've never tried them before, don't be afraid. If you're a fan of meat snacks, you'll like these without a doubt. Hell, I bet you could even get some vegetarians to convert just from the scent. :D\n",

The flavor isn't the best for this sort of thing, but it's far from the worst and is quite good.  Just not quite up to a \"five star\" rating for me.  Still, I can't complain and I'd order products from these people again, just try a different flavor or product maybe next time.<br /><br />As an aside, they also sent a sampler size pack of their \"country cut\" beef jerky in Teriyaki flavor, and that I found to be excellent.  The next thing I buy from them might be the beef jerky instead, just based on the small sample package I found that much closer to a five star product.<br /><br />I did a seperate review for the seller proper, but in brief I'd call their shipping five star, very fast and well packaged.  Just for the record without making a comment pro or con about whom they used to ship, they used US Mail.\n",

Fine tea there is not chopped beyond recognition. Think of a salad bar of various teas, all nicely dried, of course, displaying a range of colors and shapes that cry out to be sampled. Tea is, of course, a matter of taste. I especially like the Kukicha, which includes tea leaf stems that provide a richer, darker taste that I crave. Getting it from amazon.com is much easier for me, since I live in Southern California, and cheaper than at the local store that carries it.\n",

      "Review: I ordered this bonsai tree for my daughter-in-law because she listed it on her Amazon wish list as \"highest\" for this Christmas 2005.  The order came in record time, three weeks before Christmas so I set about babying the tree each day by following all of the directions to a tee!  I sprayed it and watered it  exactly as the directions stated and I placed it in a sunny well lighted area and the temperature in our condo was never below 65 degrees and that was only at night while we slept. Nonetheless, after two weeks, still a week before Christmas, the leaves began to curl, turn splotchy and fall off. I was very sad about this because the tree had looked wonderful when it arrived and it was very well packed.  But, by the time Christmas Eve arrived it had only about half of its original leaves.  We are now waiting to see if the tree does better at my daughter-in-law's home since she is very happy to have it and she'd love to keep it...she is going to try to nurture it into a healthy life.

But when I received, it was extremely healthy and taken care of. Only 3 leaves needed to be trimmed due to discoloration from being inside the box. I know it will take time to flwoer and won't expect it right away. My only concern is that the potting soil is not what I expected. I expected it to be softer and easier like the soil is supposed to be with bonsais, but instead it was regular soil with wood and rock in it. When I got to transplant it later on, I will be fixing that for sure because I want it to grow up healthy.<br />But it's growing quite well and nothing was broken or dead. It was shipped out the next day and arrived at my house 3 days later. The other negative reviews probably had their shipping take longer and that is why the leaves were dissatisfying.<br />Awesome work on this little guy, I would buy from you again. :)\n",

      "Review: These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The \"chocolate\" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as \"bite-size,\" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers.\n",

I find that other brand flavored teas have such a wonderful aroma, however, the tea tends to be bitter--tasting nothing like the intended fruited flavor.  The Ahmad strawberry tea has a rich and smooth strawberry flavor, no matter how long I allow the tea bags to steep.  My family loves it as iced tea--as do I. We enjoy it so much, I make full, three-quart pitchers at a time and its always gone by the end of the day.  This year, I have already purchased four large boxes--20ct/6 bx--120 tea bags per box and now am purchasing the last of the 10 ct/12 bx box. I've gotten some great deals on here (as low as $.12 cent/tea bag)--on the internet, this tea runs $.18-.20/tea bag which adds up when you are buying 120-240 ct boxes.\n",

      "Review: Tinkyada Brown Rice gluten free products are simply some of the best imitations of wheat noodles.  Our one child has gluten sensitivities so we're switched to some alternatives.  Tinkyada is one of the best finds.  The noodles cook over a reasonable length of time (around 15-17 minutes) and have a firm texture and a taste that is quite indistinguishable from regular noodles.  We've enjoyed the noodles with spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, and casseroles.  For texture and taste these cannot be beat for those needing something gluten free due to Celiac disease or other reasons.  Everyone in the family is willing to eat these noodles.  There is a slight taste difference when tried side by side with regular noodles but not pronounced at all unlike the yucky after taste of noodles made from bean flour.\n",

Tinkyada pasta has a pretty strong brown rice tase and a slightly off aftertaste.  The texture is a little slippery, and it disintegrates a bit while cooking.  It's still pretty good if you serve it with a sauce that you would put on a plate of brown rice, i.e., a sauce with its own texture and assertive flavor.  It's not as good if the pasta is the star of the dish.  Of the brands I've tried, Jovial is by far the best.  The brown rice taste is minimal, even nice, and it cooks more al dente than the regular wheat American brands.\n",

I had already tried \"whole wheat\" pasta and even though I eat, and actually prefer, whole wheat products like pizza and breads, the TEXTURE of the spaghetti was awful. I found whole wheat egg noodles and that was better, but I missed the look and twirl of spaghetti. I saw this; I like brown rice, it's organic, it looked edible as I measured it up in my mind and, alright, I put it into my shopping cart. I followed the instructions and boiled it for 16 minutes. I rinsed it well with cold water and added it to a large hot frying pan which had olive oil. After mixing for a minute and a half, I added Lucini  brand marinara and mixed it, covered it and, when hot, ate it. My review, excellent; be proud to serve and not have to apologize that it's healthy.<br />Like that old TV commercial used to say, \"Try It, You'll Like It.\"\n",

      "Review: The reviews were so good I just had to try this - and the result was the usual fat cold noodles tasting like rice (i.e., nothing much).  Tinkyada isn't any worse than any of the others - but I find the thickness of conventional spaghetti makes the rice taste much more noticeable.  Take this with a grain of salt, since I preferred vermicelli even before I went on a gluten-free diet (about 15 years ago), but to me, vermicelli works a lot better than conventional spaghetti, because it's thinner, making the taste (or lack thereof) less noticeable when coated with sauce.  People not on the diet notice the pasta when I use rice spaghetti, but no one has ever found fault with the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLXSS\">Ener-G Foods Rice Vermicelli, 10.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> I used to use, or the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IAIOS\">Annie Chun's Brown Rice Noodle, Pad Thai, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> (more like linguini) I've been using in place of spaghetti recently.  I still buy the Tinkyada spaghetti to use in soups - fine for chicken noodle soup, etc. - but am going back to the above products that I've been using quite happily as spaghetti for years.  Not only is the rice taste less noticeable, but the vermicelli cooks in 4 minutes or so - 1/3 the time it takes to cook Tinkyada spaghetti.  (Given my attention span, this also makes it easier for me not to forget and overcook it into a gooey mess.)\n",

      "Review: I really have to question the bias of the people who wrote the previous 25 reviews.  They must have been Tinkyada employees, friends, or family because there is no way that it tastes five-stars.<br /><br />To be fair, I do eat gluten and it is my wife who has the gluten allergy.  So I do have my own biases as I eat gluten on a daily basis.  My wife tells me that she forgets what gluten tastes like after months of going on the gluten-free diet, and she is able to eat alternatives that I believe do not taste as good as the wheat-full version.  However, my wife is not particularly fond of this product either.<br /><br />Based on the reviews, I bought this thinking this spaghetti was going to taste exactly the same as regular pasta, but the consistancy, though constant, is kind of slimy.  Additionally, the \"energy saving method\" turns the pasta especially gooey, so I do not recommend that method of cooking should you be persuaded based on the other 25 reviews.<br /><br />There are lots of other gluten-free pastas out there, like corn-based, or a mixture of potato, soy, and rice that taste a lot closer to the \"real-thing.\"  I haven't found too many alternatives on Amazon yet, but my local grocery store has a few and my wife prefers them over this brand.  So at the moment, I have 11 packets of gluten-free spaghetti that I would be happy to get rid of.\n",

I have to boil it for at least 20 minutes to get it the texture I like.

I bought a few packages because I always follow the package directions first, then I play with it if it's not to my liking.<br /><br />Attempt 1 was like eating a gummy spaghetti noodle with a nasty after taste. I had to add sauce and butter to kill the taste.<br /><br />Attempt 2 wasn't any better. It was still gummy and gluey like and the flavor wasn't very good either.<br /><br />Attempt 3 was a little better in that the water didn't look like a gelatin style mess when we drained it but the noodles were chewy and I couldn't finish the second bite.<br /><br />Attempt 4 was when I finally said no more \"pasta joy\". I ended up trying to cook it by breaking the noodles in half first, thinking maybe it just isn't that great for cooking as long noodles. Oh no. I ended up having to take out clumps of noodles, tear them apart from each other and put them back in the pot. I gave up towards the end and just threw the clumps of noodles out. The texture was slimy, gummy and sticky and the aftertaste is still like pet food.<br /><br />If you are used to over cooked spaghetti drowned in sauce, I could see how this would be great... But if you want something that tastes and acts like spaghetti, this is NOT it.<br /><br />I can't figure out how this got 5 stars. It was horrible in taste and texture and was nothing close to spaghetti. I bought Hodgkins Mills rice and flaxseed noodles and they are perfect in texture and taste.

So far, (and I have tried several) Tinkyada is the only GF pasta that I have found that is close in texture and fun as wheat spaghetti and I am including other pasta shapes in this review. My husband even likes it and I have served GF pasta with chicken and sauce over it to guests and they were suprised it was GF. It doesn't bloat you like wheat pasta. You just feel comforatbly full after a big wad of \"sketti\". One downside of any of the GF pastas is that they are stiff and breakable when cold so it is hard to use them for cold pasta salad. However, I had some that I had overcooked a little and that seemed to work pretty well for cold salad. You will have to experiment for yourself with that. At any rate, I would definitely suggest you try the spaghetti especially if you have a child who is gluten free. Also the pasta will make great mac and cheese.\n",

We've not had any problems with her chewing or digesting them--as others have.  She loves the taste, but eats them slowly enough to make the bits small pieces.  And I value how they clean her teeth.  All in all, we love them, but I watch her while she eats; I wouldn't put them in her kennel while I was away.\n",

      "Review: I use a ton of \"greenies\" or other dental products for my little dog (a 7 lb Yorkie/Maltese mix.)  She used to hate it when I left the house, so I started giving her the regular greenies as a special treat for departures only.  However, she was started to get a little chunky, so thought switching her to the \"light\" version  might be a better option.  I was initially worried because she has an insanely sensitive digestive system, but I've seen no problem thus far, and I've been using them for over a week.  She doesn't seem to notice a difference at all, and I feel comfortable knowing I'm not overfeeding her (in order to assuage my guilt for leaving in the first place!)

[I can't really comment on the fat burning because I'm also dieting and exercising.]  But I can comment on the flavor of the tea.  I use one tea bag in an insulated mug of about 14 ounces, add a heaping teaspoon of Splenda, and leave it in the mug as I drink it over two to three hours.  Probably not the best way to drink tea, I know. Nevertheless, this tea has a good, moderately strong, pleasant flavor; holds its flavor; and does not have a bitter aftertaste like some of the others I have tried.  Best of all, this was very economical [$7 for a hundred bags, and eligible for free Prime shipping].  I highly recommend this tea and plan to buy it again.  Do watch to make certain it is specifically this brand and kind, since Foojoy has several that sound similar and I have tried one of the others that I did not like as well.  [...]\n",

      "Review: I ordered this on 7/30/12. It came on 8/25/12 (not super fast, but not unreasonable coming from India). I wanted to be excited to get this product, but was initially worried about my cardamom because the small cardboard box was very warped and appeared as though it had gotten quite wet at some point. I hoped that the product inside had been packaged in a way that allowed it to remain dry. Boy was I disappointed (I've bought on amazon for years, and this is my very first review. Yep, I'm that unhappy). I cut the tape and looked inside. All of the pods were loose inside the box! They were not contained in any protective covering whatsoever. I removed the pods from the box and did locate a split plastic ziploc bag. Nothing else. It appeared as though it had no hope of keeping my product safe through the shipping process, and not just because of the split in the bag. Nope. It also was completely unsealed. I took pictures but there is no way for me to attach them to this review. The cardamom smelled musty, and I had to throw it away. I was very disappointed. I know accidents can happen, but placing my cardamom into a low quality plastic bag, failing to seal it, and tossing it into a cardboard box just doesn't cut it. This is a poor practice when shipping from so far. I cannot tell if the cardamom would have been fresh otherwise, I will not order again.\n",

I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The \"chocolate\" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as \"bite-size,\" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.

They are perfect for school snack or in the car.  The cookies are tasty enough that Mom and Dad (who do eat wheat) will snack on them as well.  They are quite pricey in the store, but Amazon's subscription price makes them fairly affordable - and much easier than always making homemade.\n",

If it didn't say \"Extra Bold,\" I would not have guessed this was an Extra Bold K-Cup; the flavor just isn't there.\n",

      "Review: If you ever go to an Indian restaurant with me, order your own papadams (English spellings vary). Once these delicious wafers get to the table, I suddenly become sharing-impaired.<br /><br />You've certainly seen them at Indian restaurants. They're the saucer-sized crispy wafers. Thin, crunchy, and often seasoned with big flavors (black pepper, cumin, garlic, or chilis, to name a few), these call to mind some Western crispy snacks, all of which pale in comparison. Made with bean flour, these offer a bit of protein with their crunch, but without a bean-y flavor. And, if it matters, you don't have to be a chemist to pronounce any of the ingredients.<br /><br />I've had a few flavors in the Lijjat line, including plain. I've had other brands, too, but this is the one I keep coming back to. These can be cooked many ways, including frying or toasting over an open flame - but a stack of three in the microwave for a minute come out very nearly as good, and with fewer calories than you might expect. Each package contains about 15 wafers, so the 20-pack is only for large families or the truly fanatical. If you can't get to an Indian grocer, though, consider splitting with some friends. They'd better be good friends, though, because sharing is a real problem.<br /><br />-- wiredweird\n",

I tend to roast mine over an open flame (god bless gas stoves!), but my sister-in-law likes to do hers in the microwave. It's the papad that my mother bought in India, and it's the one that I buy in New York. We're trying to watch our weight, so these are a much tastier, lower fat, higher nutrition, version of potato crisps that you see in the stores all the time.<br /><br />Like the other reviewer, I have a tough time sharing these, so the 20 pack isn't unreasonable for me. Think about it: you have a snack that's ready in seconds, and can be eaten with pickles, with chutneys, with meals, or all by itself. AND it's not dripping with fat. I have a lot of friends over, so I tend to run through papad fairly quickly.\n",

      "Review: This stuff is great, my kids love it!  No artificial colors, flavors, no sugar, and no harmful chemicals like the blue stuff, pink stuff, or yellow stuff.<br /><br />You have to know how to do it right though!<br /><br />First off, use about half of what they suggest.  You can always add more later if you want more, but with Stevia if you use too much it will taste bitter.  Some flavors require more than 1/2 strength.  With orange for example I use their recommended amounts, but the other flavors are anywhere from 1/2 to 2/3 the recommended amounts.  Always start with less and add more until it tasts right for you.<br /><br />Secondly, it takes a long time for it to dissolve.  Mix it in and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before trying any, and really it is best after sitting in the fridge overnight.  If you just dump some in the top and take a drink you will be VERY disappointed as it will clump and just sit there.<br /><br />We use a dispensing refrigerator container so the kids can serve themselves.

      "Review: I was dissapointed with this product's retail price.  While the bitter taste known to accomplany stevia was reduced in this product, I felt that there just wasn't enough powder to make it worth the cash compared to other non-aspartame based powdered drinks out on the market.  The usage directions are abysmal on the bottle, so I went with what most people stated here and started with a small quantity of powder.  I blended it very well using a blendy bottle, which is a 28oz bottle that contains a coiled circular spring inside that slices through the water, stirring with every shake.  While I can't comment on how well it tastes if you mix and let settle for long periods of time, I never had an issue with clumping or not having enough flavor.<br /><br />As for flavors, all I bought were pretty tasty.  I ordered cherry, orange, lemon-lime, strawberry, and grape all at once when there was a decent sale going.  this was in september 2009.<br /><br />Even though you don't need much powder to get a good taste, the company doesn't give any estimation as to how much you should use or how much a bottle makes.  With that in mind at the price its at, I find it hard to give this product more than 3 stars.  If it was four dollars I'd think it was a steal and easily give another star, as I estimate each jar will make upwards of 2-3 gallons, maybe more if used sparingly. at $9.95, sorry, I just can't.  I'm back to my old ways of using a touch of stevia from packets to sweeten my water and topping it off with whichever citrus fruits are on sale (a squeeze of lemon, lime, or orange for flavor).\n",

I am a bold/espresso drinker and my mom is a weak coffee drinker, but we can agree on this.  You won't be disappointed!\n",

      "Review: I figured this coffee would be great from seeing the good reviews. I'm starting to think they are from the company. I was looking for a good southern pecan coffee and this tastes nothing like pecans. It tastes like hazelnut. If I wanted hazelnut, I would buy it. The coffee itself tastes okay, but it doesn't taste how it should. I expected better from this company since I love their other flavors.\n",

Read the various customer reviews and this brand seemed to be the perfect choice.<br /><br />This is what I've found since purchasing it:  The coffee is very weak in flavor, watery in taste and........when you grind more coffee beans to compensate........it doesn't improve.  No creamy, rich flavor - not even close.<br /><br />For my money, I will never buy this coffee again.  It's just not worth it.\n",

It's a little salty for my taste.  Water it down.  So, one package suggests 2 gallons of water...I would add an additional gallon of water.  Or whatever you like to get it just right.<br /><br />But it is awesome, it's got the aroma of Pho, it's semi-oily at the top of the broth...I mean...good, good, good!!!\n",

      "Review: My wife and I have been trying to make Pho like the ones at the Vietnamese restaurant but no sucess.  When comes to Pho, I am very, very picky on how it should taste.  I've gone to many restaurants and even some of their pho does not meet my expectation....only a few select restaurants actually does.  First time I found VV Foods' Pho base was in an asian store.  Unfortunately, they don't always have it in stock.  I guess someone else found out the \"secret\" base as well.  I called up VV Foods and they said that I can order directly through them or through Amazon.  Best Pho base ever.  Even if you can't cook, this pho base will make you a pro.\n",

      "Review: I've been trying to make beef Pho at home for several months now with zero success. I finally did some extra searching when looking for some type of Pho base and found this. I read the reviews and ordered instantly.<br />It's so good. It's as good as our local restaurant. I followed some advice such as using less base so I made a gallon and used 4oz (5oz or half jar is what it calls for) or base and one spice packet. I let the spice packet boil for about an hour. I tasted it after the first boil as the instructions say but it didn't have as much flavor as I like.<br />My whole family loved it.<br />The only thing is I used rice stick noodles that weren't very good. I've tried thin rice noodles but those were about the same as the sticks. My local restaurant uses rice noodles that are very soft and look close to an angel hair pasta size. Maybe I'm not cooking the rice noodles long enough because they didn't get as soft as I like.\n",

My only complaint was that it was a bit too salty for my taste.  I added an extra quart of water to dillute but it was still too salty.  Next time, I may use a bit less of the beef base.  I would definately recommend this product.\n",

      "Review: Yes! I don't have a pho restaurant anywhere near me.  This is the next best thing.  It truly has the pho flavor.  It comes with a jar of pho \"paste\" and two packets of seasoning.  I make two batches out of these and it makes a lot. I can also freeze any extra broth for later use.  I don't follow the directions regarding the onion and ginger.  I just simmer one seasoning packet for an hour to really pull out the spicy flavor, then I add half the paste mix.  Serve with the traditional pho ingredients.  YUM.\n",

      "Review: I fell in love with Pho on the east coast and when I moved to Texas one of the saddest moments was realizing there was no Vietnamese restaurant. I could not even get some of the spices in the recipes I found online. I tried five different times to make it from scratch, or from other Asian mixes, etc. and failed miserably.<br /><br />THIS IS IT! It's perfect. It tastes JUST LIKE the Pho at Pho Vung Tau... a perfect broth. JUST GREAT. With beef, chicken, or seafood, and romaine, sprouts, rice noodles plus fish, hoisin, limes and srichia (sp?) sauce, it's amazing!! I introduced this dish to my neighbors and Texas family and they're all Pho addicts now too. Especially fun with sweet fish dip and Chun's shrimp spring rolls. :) Can't say enough how great this stuff is if you love Pho and want to have it at home.<br /><br />Did I mention this is VERY YUMMY???? I wish I could post a picture to show how incredibly *pretty* this broth is when it's completed - such a rich color with a great sheen.<br /><br />A-plus!\n",

      "Review: Altho this is a good pho base to make at home, however, the expiration is not visibly outside on the box but on the bottom of the jar inside the box.  I bought a couple of these from a local store and have been using them last week.  Just now I notice that they have expired three months ago.  I checked the box and see no dates so I made a call to VV Foods asking why expiration is not outside on the box instead.  The lady told me that the FDA's law that they have to have an expiration date stamped on the bottom or on the lid of the jar and not the outside packaging.  Also,  it's the store's responsibility to check and rotate the products.  She then educate me that consumers have the right to open the boxes to check on expiration dates and take back to store for refund if products expired.  Uh, each box contains 2 spice packages inside and for a customer to open the boxes up just to get a non-expired product would look very weird and even a waste of time.  And really made no sense at all.<br /><br />What if you buy from online because they're not available at local stores?  I don't think it would be a problem with Amazon to refund and/or resend but if it is Amazon's responsibility to open up the packaging to check for expiration dates before sending them to their customers would cause a problem in their shipping lines.\n",

    "**Os resultados do cross-validation para o modelo SVM com kernel linear são bastante promissores, mostrando uma média consistente de aproximadamente 0.89 para todas as métricas: acurácia, precisão, recall e F1-score. Isso sugere que o modelo está generalizando bem para diferentes dobras (splits) do conjunto de dados de treinamento, o que é um bom indicativo de robustez e desempenho geral do modelo.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Esses resultados também indicam que o modelo SVM com kernel linear está mantendo seu desempenho mesmo quando exposto a diferentes subconjuntos dos dados de treinamento, o que é crucial para garantir que o modelo não esteja apenas \"decorando\" os dados de treinamento específicos, mas sim aprendendo padrões que podem ser aplicados a novos dados de forma geral.**\n",

    "**Essa análise de validação cruzada ajuda a confirmar a confiabilidade do modelo SVM com kernel linear e sugere que ele pode ser uma escolha sólida para a classificação de sentimentos neste contexto.**"
